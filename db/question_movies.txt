QuestionKenntnis:
Why isn't Bruce Willis's character in the Sixth Sense self-aware?
qn_description:
Why doesn't Bruce Willis's character realize he is dead? 

If I remember correctly, the plot takes place several months after he is killed. Shouldn't there have been some clues during that time? They do imply that he thinks his wife isn't speaking to him because she's angry, but is it really possible that she was the only person he expected to interact with? 

Additionally, it seems that all the other ghosts in the movie know they're dead. So perhaps another question would be do all ghosts in The Sixth Sense go through a "transition period" where they don't realize they're dead? At what point to they become aware of it?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
This line from Cole I think summed it up best, "They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead."  

And, except for the girl trying to save her sister, I don't know if you could definitively say any of the other ghosts knew they were ghosts. I think the "They only see what they want to see" bit is the key here. In a way the ghosts are making their own reality.
AnswerKenntnis:
I am from Sri Lanka, and the idea that ghosts are unaware of the fact that they are dead is not totally alien here. I'm pretty sure Shyamalan was aware of these types of myths.
QuestionKenntnis:
To what extent are child actors exposed to the violent aspects of the movie they perform in?
qn_description:
Some movies feature child characters put in violent situations. This can range from crude language to extreme horror (e.g. torture, gore, etc.). As an example, Child's Play and its sequel has plenty of those scenes. It looks like a paradox that children can be actors in movies that are definitely not for children.

Do the directors usually try and avoid exposing the very young actors to the violence of such scenes, e.g. by clever dubbing and editing? Are there laws that require them to do so, just like there are ratings that prevent children from seeing some movies?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
I have worked with children on horror films/thrillers and, having found no official guidelines from SAG other than payment policies such as Coogan's Law, I have usually employed a number of tactics.

Firstly, I'll go over the scene and storyboard very carefully with the child's parents/guardians (although this isn't always constructive as many parents will let their child do anything to get them on screen ;)).

The simplest way I have found is to show the child the effects in play; we look at the props, the make-up, we play with the other actors, and I always use a sweet, edible blood and call it 'juice'.

Sometimes our shooting ratio doubles as we end up having to cut more often when the kids or other actors start giggling during a particularly gruesome effect.

The previous answers, regarding angles, solo shots and clever editing are spot on.
AnswerKenntnis:
A fun example from "The Shining": 


  Because Danny Lloyd was so young and since it was his first acting
  job, Stanley Kubrick was highly protective of the child. During the
  shooting of the movie, Lloyd was under the impression that the film he
  was making was a drama, not a horror movie. He only realized the truth
  seven years later, when, aged 13, he was shown a heavily edited
  version of the film. He didn't see the uncut version of the film until
  he was 17 - eleven years after he'd made it.
AnswerKenntnis:
The editing, filming techniques, and set attitude can seriously change the perception of what is actually going on.  In various horror movie "behind the scenes" (last I can think of is Sam Raimi commentary on Evil Dead), it seems like casts for horror flicks are very upbeat and everybody is having fun.  With many horror films it's only once the scenes are cut, music is injected and packaged that it finally becomes scary.

If this is true, then any child exposed to certain situations could perceive what's going on as a "game."  A great example could be a scenario from "Child's Play."  A director can say, "Hey, I'm going to throw you this doll, let's see if you can catch him."

While I can't speak for all parents, but some would definitely be on set to make sure that the child in question isn't overly exposed to "uncomfortable elements."  However I can't speak for Linda Blair on "The Exorcist."
AnswerKenntnis:
I have also worked on film sets and I concur with @Nobby. I think a larger point, though, is that situations are generally only ΓÇ£scaryΓÇ¥ when actors are in character. For example consider Halloween. An adult dressed like a corpse and covered in bruise makeup and fake blood isnΓÇÖt scary to most children if sheΓÇÖs chatting and laughing and walking around as if nothing was wrong. ItΓÇÖs only when she gets in character, acting as if in pain etc., that it begins to seem scary. Then consider that on a typical film set, the mantra is ΓÇ£hurry up and waitΓÇ¥ΓÇöthe camera isnΓÇÖt rolling for the majority of the shooting day. Even on the 10% or 20% of the time that the camera is rolling and the actors are in character and so on, there are still constant interruptions (between takes) when everyone resets and breaks character again. If anything, itΓÇÖs harder to get kids to actually act scared than the other way around, when theyΓÇÖre surrounded by dozens of adults (the crew) who are completely at ease the entire time.

And this only really applies to people. Professional prosthetic makeup these days can be incredible (think Star Trek) and can look completely real even in real life inches awayΓÇöbut monsters and other entirely fake things often look laughably fake in real life. Just think of what a demon mask looks like in a costume store; thatΓÇÖs what movie monsters look like in real life. They only become scary on screen due to lighting and movement and sound effects. And non-computer-generated ones are either very still or operated by puppeteers, which makes them even harder to get scared by.
AnswerKenntnis:
I'm almost certain it comes down to parent permission and what they are comfortable allowing the child to see when working with the directors.  Some are naturally more lenient than others while I'm sure some are only allowed on set to film their scenes and they never get to see what they filmed after post-production because of it being too graphic.

(The rest of this is speculative, take it with a grain of salt)

As far as specific laws, I know there must be some laws that prohibit a parent from explicitly forcing your child from watching disturbing content.  Viewing alone or under parent supervision is not against any law that I can think of.
AnswerKenntnis:
Base on the symbolic interaction there is a two-way influence between culture and cinema. As Herbert Blumer said: "IT is difficult to determine exactly the extent of this influence". 

Mostly during shooting understanding abut specific shot or shots is completely different from what we see in the screen, because the deconstruction of motion and the behind the camera crew  normally make actors very far from the Gaze from audiences that watch film in cinema.
So, we can give two separate answer to your question, in first part we need to understand about the different between effect of watching film and have a role in film, because all the effect that force lawmaker to make the limitation on the audiences are base on shared cultural structure and shared social structures that guid the their attention to percipient that cause to form a meaning in the audiences mind. So this process is different with filmmaking process, because in its process and actors involving in their role there is not the process of performance cause: percipient cause: meaning.

Blumer did a research on 200 boys under twelve years of age who were asked if they played in things seen in the movies. 75% answered Yes. Of 70 ranging in age from 12 to 14 years, 60% indicated that they played in what was seen in the movies. Among a group of boys between 14 and 16 years, 25% admitted still engaging in plays reflecting the influence of motion pictures. 
All these three groups consisted of boys living in one of the slum areas in Chicago (Blumer Herbert, 1933).So we can extend this result of interaction to the insider underage actors, and think that only law can not determine the reality of cultural perception. All the human interaction to the film even as actor or as audiences is different from the social limitation that create by the law and it is more related to the norm.(http://archive.org/stream/moviesandconduct00blumrich#page/12/mode/2up)

In other hand and related to the note that i write here from Blumer, the effect of playing or getting a role in such a film that you ask can manipulated the underage audiences, so it make a some social queer appearance on them.
QuestionKenntnis:
What caused and ended the time loop in Groundhog Day?
qn_description:
I've always wondered what caused the Time Loop experienced by Phil Connors in Groundhog Day, as well as what ended it, but I don't recall it being discussed in the movie.

What was the cause for the time loop featured in Groundhog Day, and why did it end?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
According to this review answering such questions in the movie itself would have "ruined" it. The original script contained an explanation of the start of the time loop - a voodoo spell - but that was considered a poor idea.

So, I wonder if there is a conclusive answer to your question. It was deliberately left out by Harold Ramis. We are left speculating about it (maybe even encouraged to do so) and I think that is one of the reasons why this movie has had so much impact.
AnswerKenntnis:
I don't believe a formal answer was ever provided in the movie, but it seemed to require Phil to finally diverge from a path of pure selfishness and embrace the ideals of love and respect for other human beings. He started the movie disrespecting the cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and the producer Rita (Andi MacDowell) by blowing off the ceremony by being late, providing poor commentary, and acting generally boorish to everybody including town officials, the landlady, and former acquaintances like Ned. He needed to see his disrespect of them through many incarnations of the day and change his attitude. Only when his attitude was proved to be changed by his love of Rita, was he able to escape the time loop.
AnswerKenntnis:
It's a very very hidden big irony.

He started the movie as a jerk and egotist, with everything in his mind being about him and not caring about others. At least, on a minor, 1-person scale. We are led to believe that this perception of things being about him are wrong.

Then, as we find out after the movie ends (see wbogacz's excellent answer), the whole universe was frozen in thousands of days of a loop, all for the express purpose of providing a lesson to Phil that his initial worldview is wrong.

Except, in the end, it is all about Phil. The only mistake in the beginning that he made was the scale - the whole UNIVERSE is about him, not just an individual personal bubble of things around him.
AnswerKenntnis:
While I like wbogacz's and DVK's answers very much, I humbly suggest they are incomplete.  It's about more than overcoming selfishness or solipsism (all about me) or even insufficient solipsism, as keen an insight as that is.  For me the answer to the original question comes when the movie is taken as allegorical, an analogy for one of life's deepest lessons.

When today is invested in tomorrow, only that breaks the monotonous cycle of days.

Yes selflessness is a part of that.  So is empathy as an antidote to solipsism.  But neither explain the piano lessons.  Those represent pure and simple investment today into a better tomorrow, and so form a part of the escape from each new day being no better -- being indistinguishable -- from the last.

I know little of Buddhism (and half of that from just now reading Wikipedia) but the lesson reminds me of the Buddhist concept of liberating oneself from the endless cycle of suffering and rebirth.  I wonder if reincarnation was originally an analogy for the same concept: to invest in today for a better tomorrow is to attain greatness.
AnswerKenntnis:
It was a miracle of God intervening in his life.

For whatever reason, he was permitted to experience reality over and over and over again, while fully cognizant and fully remembering everything prior.

It's like conscious reincarnation, each day being a new life, only with him starting out as a 45 yro instead of an infant.

After thousands of days, he had successfully traversed from


infant - not knowing what the heck is going on,
child - innocent child trying to figure things out,
teenager - hedonistically having fun, robbing banks, dying, etc.,
adult - trying to make things right, seeking Enlightenment (piano playing, learning foreign languages, etc.),
wise sage - a state near enlightenment where only Today mattered and all his desires were overlooked for the benefit of others and the betterment of the world. Rita was a perk, not his sole mission.


In this sense, the movie is a clear indication of the cycle of Reincarnation, albeit one where this individual did not have to be reset continuously inorder to progress.

The ending is him literally breaking out of Maya (illusion), as the Hindus say, and leading a wholly Activated, Enlightened existence, without the need of further reincarnations.
AnswerKenntnis:
I remember seeing an interview, somewhere that I can't for the life of me find now, where it was said that what broke the spell was Bill Murray's kissing the hotel owner.  Apparently "the music shimmers" right then, or something.

This question has been bugging me from the moment I finished watching the film.
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
According to co-writer/producer Bob Gale:


  We never explained it in the movie. But the history of the characters that Bob Zemeckis and I created is this:
  
  
  For years, Marty was told that Doc Brown was dangerous, a crackpot, a lunatic. So, being a red-blooded American teenage boy, age 13 or 14, he decided to find out just why this guy was so dangerous. Marty snuck into DocΓÇÖs lab, and was fascinated by all the cool stuff that was there. when Doc found him there, he was delighted to find that Marty thought he was cool and accepted him for what he was. Both of them were the black sheep in their respective environments. Doc gave Marty a part-time job to help with experiments, tend to the lab, tend to the dog, etc.
  
  
  And thatΓÇÖs the origin of their relationship.
QuestionKenntnis:
First movie with product placement?
qn_description:
We were watching The Goonies (1985) tonight and I noticed that in the initial scenes one of the characters is rather prominently holding a Pepsi in his hand.



I know product placement has been a marketing technique used in movies for a long time now, and I doubt Goonies was the first movie to do this -- but what was the first movie to truly popularize or highlight getting paid for placing a product in a movie?

Also, any historical background / context on product placement in movies, or movies that made notable early marketing deals which resembled product placement, is welcome.

I'm trying to understand how this started, since the future of advertising seems to be this seamless paid integration of products into plots, rather than separate ads.
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
In the documentary "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold" (a film specifically about the topic of product placement), director Morgan Spurlock notes that one of the first recognized product placements was in the 1919 Roscoe Arbuckle comedy The Garage, in which a Red Crown Gasoline logo was displayed on screen.

I expect watching the documentary would more than likely provide insight into product placement's rise in popularity in tv and film.

How did "Jack" (the narrator) manage to attract people to join Fight Club?
qn_description:
In Fight Club "Jack" (the narrator) and Tyler Durden pick a fight behind the bar and through that fight they manage to attract people to first join the fight and then after founding Fight Club, to join the club.  

As we proceed through the film we realize that Jack and Tyler are actually one person.  

The catch here is that, how did he manage to get those people start fighting?  

I mean by beating himself up he looks more like a lunatic than a badass.
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
I think it was the argument more than the fighting that attracted them.  Remember Tyler's philosophy is "self-improvement is like masturbation, but self-destruction is good" or something like that.  If he was beating himself up, and then told other people that philosophy, it's easy to see how a club dedicated to self-destruction and the Tyler Durden philosophy came together.
AnswerKenntnis:
The first time you see the fight, some people look at them because they're interested in the fight, and then later ask him if they could have a go one time.

Then later, when it turns out he was beating himself up, it still makes sense actually, because it's still a valid reason for them to go looking at him, and also to ask if they could have a go (in this second case meaning punching him). When the first fight started it all makes sense as in the first case actually.

That's what I thought of it at least.

Why don't Marty's parents ever mention how similar he looks to the Marty of 1955?
qn_description:
Although Marty is only in 1955 for one week, he plays a pivotal role in getting his parents together. He even briefly dates his mother. So, considering he plays such a pivotal role, does it make sense that his parents never mention that he looks so similar to their old friend?

Is it not mentioned to simply cover up a plot hole, or is it likely that the producers simply overlooked this?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
There is a definitive answer to one part of this question:


  Is it likely that the producers simply overlooked this?


No. It was intentionally removed from the original draft. (Obviously this version is fairly different)

Here's the original ending of the script:


  INSERT ΓÇô CLIPPING A story with the headline, ΓÇ£Police Quell Near Riot At School Dance,ΓÇ¥ along with a photo of the dance that shows Marty on stage!
  
  GEORGE stares at the photo, then shakes his head.
  
  GEORGE Nah. CouldnΓÇÖt be.
AnswerKenntnis:
Even if they would notice, they would never accept it as a truth, because it is much against a normal understanding of the world.

It would be probably like:

"Ever notice how much Marty looks like that one guy I nearly fell in love with?"

"Yeah, funny that".

And thats it :). 
They could never imagine/reason, that Marty did time travel. So it is not even a possibility and therefore would not seem to be strange.
AnswerKenntnis:
Remember that cat your parents took in for one week when you were a child?  Isn't it strange that it looks exactly like the kitten you've been raising down to the last stripe?

You don't remember what that cat looked like?

I don't remember my childhood best friend's face very well and I knew him for years.  Had I met him and knew him for a week I doubt I would even remember the details.

This isn't a plot hole.
AnswerKenntnis:
Suppose the parents did notice the similarity. What would the chances be that they noticed exactly in the '85 time frames the movie shows? Nil.
AnswerKenntnis:
It doesn't matter

His parents never mention the similarity in the movie because:


Before the 1955 part of the  movie, it would be somewhat of a spoiler.
After the 1955 part of the movie, it might have worked, but it would have been "cute dialog of convenience" and not really realistic there.


Ultimately, if you accept the underlying premise of Back to the Future which is that if key events stay more or less the same, the future will be unchanged, then you have to accept that whether his parents saw the similarity or not is irrelevant.  This is good news.  You can either choose to believe they never noticed a similarty, or you can choose to believe that at some point in Marty's alternate youth, his parents showed him a picture of this guy he bears an uncanny resemblance to, and none of them including alternate past Marty had any idea it actually was him yet, and then they went about the rest of their lives normally.  Whether either theory is correct is irrelevant, because according to the rules of the BTTF universe, it doesn't actually change anything.
AnswerKenntnis:
It was 30 years ago for Marty's parents.  I can barely remember what happened 30 days ago, I can't imagine remembering something from 30 years prior.  Now given that Marty's parents encounter with "Calvin Klein" is what brought them together, I doubt they could remember what he looked like some 30 years later.  I would say it's plausible that they would remember his name, but not his face.
AnswerKenntnis:
Who is to say they DIDN'T notice and comment on it... but we didn't see it? What would they have said anyway?


  Lorraine: Wow, Marty! You look just like a highschool friend of ours.
  Honey, c'mere! Look at Marty. Doesn't he look like that friend of
  yours, Kevin?
  
  George: You mean Calvin? Oh yeah, he does! Shame we don't have any
  photos of him. Honestly, if he hadn't had disappeared all those years
  ago, I'd have sworn you'd been cheating on me!
  
  Lorraine: Oh, honey! As if I'd cheat on you...

What would YOUR parents say if you resembled a childhood friend they hadn't seen in 30 years?
QuestionKenntnis:
How do they film the mirror scenes in movies?
qn_description:
It always makes me wonder how do they place the cameras and crew members while filming a scene which is opposite to a reflecting object, such as mirror.  Because, when filming the reflected objects we should see the camera and cameraman because of their reflection.  But this does not happen in the movies.

How do they film the scenes with an actor facing a mirror?  Why don't we see the cameras and crew?

What is the technique they use to film the scenes with reflecting objects?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
If you look closely, you'll almost always note that the mirror is angled so the camera is out of its view. This is sometimes masked by the actor looking directly into [the reflection of] the camera, which gives the impression that he is looking at himself in the mirror. 

However, there are at least two other options for getting a shot in which the camera should, by rights, be visible but isn't:


one is using visual effects (optical or CGI) for the reflection.
The other was used by James Cameron in Terminator 2: Cameron wanted a tracking
shot (camera moving sideways) behind Linda Hamilton removing a chip
from Ahnold's head in front of a mirror. If done with a mirror, the
camera would have been visible as it moved around behind the actors.

Rather than do this with effects, the set was built so that the mirror was actually a window, and on the other side was a complete mirror-image version of the set on the camera side. Schwartzenegger and Linda sat on the far side facing the camera, and a fancy Arnold puppet and Linda's twin sister sat with their backs to the camera, mimicking all of the moves of their counterparts.


Other example are:   


In the case of Being John Malkovich, where the shot was from his POV 
the camera man just stood in front of an emtpy frame in the wall with
Malcovich standing 'inside' the wall on a reverse set of the scene...
In the bad attempt of Sucker Punch scene in the dressing room when Sweet Pea, Rocket and Blondie talk about not helping Baby Doll, their movements not matching their mirror images (especially Sweet Pea's). Doubles are being used. This is done so the camera can move behind them without being reflected. You can watch it at this link

The ending of the film Shutter Island is purposely ambiguous, with two different interpretations:


Teddy was crazy, and the whole movie was part of a role-play therapy.
There is a conspiracy to convince Teddy that he's crazy so that he doesn't expose the unethical and illegal things that are going on.

  Teddy Daniels: You know, this place makes me wonder.
  Chuck Aule: Yeah, what's that, boss?
  Teddy Daniels: Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?
  [gets up and walks off]
  Chuck Aule: Teddy?  
  
  Teddy, or more realistically, Andrew, is aware of what was going on when he was on the steps with Chuck. The guards were there even. On those steps, when he said that, that was his way of saying I know but I want to pretend anyway.


The evidence for the other side isn't that strong based on Andrew's reaction to


Government conspiracy (even I was hoping it was a huge plot but it was becoming more impossible as neared the end of the movie)
Drugs and cigarettes shouldn't necessarily make you hallucinate more. Since he was in a hospital for the criminally insane, drugs should be suppressing hallucinations and erratic behaviour not causing them.
Noyce saying his real name and then beating him up.
AnswerKenntnis:
He is crazy, that's obvious. At a certain point of the film he realizes what he did in the past and he explain everything to the doctor with a lot of details that nobody could have told him.
There's the first part, with the bout and everything with him getting to the island that it's hard to believe he could have imagined it. This is the only "proof" of a conspiracy that i recall.
AnswerKenntnis:
In the initial story, the suspense novel, it was wholly intended that Daniels is crazy. I think it was Scorseze's creative input that made the film what it was. In the film, both possibilities are equally possible. Again, this is not the original intent of the story, but an artistic change in the film.

He's crazy:
(Dr. Cawley explains that patients were submerged in water until unconscious OR DROWNED)
       This is an attempt of Cawley's to jar Laeddis' memory of his wife's crime

(The "real" Rachel Solando)
       This is a further projection as a part of his paranoid insanity

(Dead Chuck off of the cliff)
       Yet another projection

("is it better to live as a monster or die a good man?"
       Andrew Laeddis, now sane, telling his doctor that he is allowing himself to be neutralized to forget the horror of his actions.

There are many more, but here are just a few scenarios that are circumstantial to the interpretation.

He's not crazy:
(Dr. Cawley explains that patients were submerged in water until unconscious OR DROWNED)
       This is an attempt of Cawley's to seed a portion of this false reality that     they are going to impress upon Daniels

(The "real" Rachel Solando)
       This can be a real discovery which is why she mentions aspects of the case that aren't later addressed, like his cigarettes, she also is very logical. It is important to realize that though the procedures she claims that the doctors are trying to perform aren't suggested to have succeeded, so they really aren't too far fetched. She also mentions factual aspects of the case not later addressed, like the ice pick shown at the end of the film.

(Dead Chuck off of the cliff)
       Another aspect of the forced insanity, Chuck Aul was always Dr. Sheehan and placing a fake dead body and removing the character is an attempt to make Daniels think he's hallucinating.

("is it better to live as a monster or die a good man?"
       This is Teddy Daniels' surrender to the tact of the hospital, admitting defeat. But it is also a stab at Dr. Sheehan saying, "yeah, you guys are going to kill me, but you have to live with yourself as a monster." He is then ushered toward the lighthouse that is supposedly empty.

There are many more two-sided hints, it really spices up the film to seek them out for yourself. But there are also undeniable clues that show that the original intent is his insanity. Clues like his projection of Laeddis being fantastic and overly-dramatic, he has two different colored eyes and his face is divided by a scar, this is a physical picture of the divided nature of his psyche. Also, the anagrams in the names are too concrete to be coincidence.

So what we have is the struggle between a writer who intended a story about an insane man in denial, and a director who intends to force an unsolvable, parallel mystery.

Next time you watch the film, consider these two realities:


Andrew Laeddis killed his wife because she drowned their three children, he then was sent to a mental health facility. Taking advantage of an impending storm, the head psychologist, Dr. Cawley, and Laeddis' main primary, Dr. Sheehan decide to stage a roll play outlining Laeddis' false reality to prove to him that there is no fact in his suspicions. Laeddis pretends to relapse into insanity to escape living with the regret of his real past.
Federal marshal Edward Daniels' pursuit of the man responsible for his wife's death has led him to stumble upon a government-funded hospital who are secretly experimenting upon their patients to build controllable soldiers (not necessarily successfully). His investigation has caught the attention of the hospital who have staged a fake prisoner-escape to get him on the island where they can make it seem as if he's gone crazy. This is a tactic they have used in the past on prying eyes like Dr. Rachel Solondo. Dr. Cowley, with the help of a fellow doctor in disguise as a federal marshal, then successfully quiet the snooping marshal and take them to their lab in a lighthouse.


(In neither case is the escape real or is Chuck a real marshal)
AnswerKenntnis:
I have read the book. Dennis Lehane's book. I can definitely assure that He was crazy. The whole roleplay scenario was doctor's plan to get him out of his sickness. Eventually he gets cured but because of the guilt he acts like he hasn't been cured and dies.
AnswerKenntnis:
He is crazy. I really wonder how people can see this as an 'implanted memories'-game. The character Leonarde portrays is obviously 'realizing' stuff and the moment you rewatches this movie you actually see all these hints in the rest of the patients that show they have trouble to play along with 'yet another' attempt to heal him. They are obviously playing along and not being punished or threatened to do so. Do you think this would have worked the same way if the staff would have made patients forcefully play along to try to brainwash a person again and again and again? Would the patients react the same way? They are confused and anxious and nervous because they are scared they'll do something wrong, but they aren't scared to death, frightened and terrified for their lives about doing something wrong. 

The only part the movie makes you wonder about is what happens to him in the end and if he is consciously making the decision to die, by pretending he's gone back to his little mindplay again, or that he's actually gone back to his previous state of mind. I can understand people debate that. But just watch the movie again and you'll notice this is not about 'implanted memories' and brainwashing, but actually the opposite. Trying to free someone from their own brainwashing.

It's pretty straight forward. It messes with your head, because it doesn't let you understand everything from the start. But watch it again my friend, and you'll see it's pretty straight forward. You'll be surprised at suddenly viewing a totally different movie. Which is intrigueing and more sad than the first time you watched it.
QuestionKenntnis:
What has the greatest chance of being in Marcellus Wallace's briefcase in Pulp Fiction
qn_description:
In Pulp Fiction, there is a briefcase who's content is kept very secret. What item gathers the most evidence for being in the briefcase?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Roger Avary, the co-writer of Pulp Fiction says:


  Originally the briefcase contained diamonds.  But that just seemed too
  boring and predictable.  So it was decided that the contents of the
  briefcase were never to be seen.  This way each audience member would
  fill in the blank with their own ultimate contents.  All you were
  supposed to know was that it was "so beautiful."  No prop master can
  come up with something better than each individual's imagination.  At
  least that was the original idea.  Then somebody had the bright idea
  (which I think was a mistake) of putting an orange lightbulb in there.
  Suddenly what could have been anything became anything supernatural. 
  Didn't need to push the effect.  People would have debated it for
  years anyway, and it would have been much more subtle.  I can't
  believe I'm actually talking about being subtle.


from Roger Ebert's Questions for the Movie Answer Man
AnswerKenntnis:
Well people try and make tenuous Links between reservoir dogs and pulp fiction, by that I mean people try and see if they hold up as sequels, whether continuity wise they can work. A logical opinion is to say that the diamonds that are stolen in Dogs are what are in the brief case in Fiction. However Harvey Keitel and Quentin Tarantino act as two different people in both films. So this still doesn't hold true. I heard a theory that it was Wallaces soul that was in the case. Evidence for this is that losing his soul is what the injury on the back of his neck is. However that seems far fetched.
AnswerKenntnis:
I've always assumed (despite Avary's explanation) that it was a clever movie reference to the McGuffins in two previous movies. 

The most recent being the great Repo Man (Dir Alex Cox, 1984) where a briefcase purported to contain alien remains and which glows mysteriously is a key thread. This, in turn, may have some relationship with the case of radioactive material in the great noir thriller Kiss Me Deadly (Dir Robert Aldrich, 1955).

If you are going to include references to other movies (a known Tarantino trait) those are two awesome movies to reference.
AnswerKenntnis:
I heard the theory that @JosephLynn mentioned about it being Wallace's soul - and relating it to the injury on the back of his neck.  The theory only has slim backing - the glow, the band-aid, the combination of the briefcase (666) and the 'miracle' that happens as Vince and Jules come to take the soul back, perhaps rescuing it from the devil.

Obviously the quote from Avery saying that they didn't have a fixed idea of what it was kind of trumps that.
AnswerKenntnis:
Until reading the other answers here I always assumes that it contained gold bars because of the orange glow. I know this is a slightly boring conclusion but I don't think that Pulp Fiction is supernatural in any way and the theory about Wallace's soul is just silly.

It had to be something very valuable due to Tim Roth's reaction to it and the colour of the glow makes me think gold rather than diamonds.
AnswerKenntnis:
I'm afraid I must also weigh in with boring old, run of the mill diamonds. I read that Tarantino didn't want to use diamonds (even though that's what is in the briefcase according to the script) because he'd just come off Reservoir Dogs which featured a diamond heist.
QuestionKenntnis:
What is going on in Mulholland Drive?
qn_description:
I know that David Lynch's movies are all very deep and hard to grasp and that probably there is no simple answer to this question, as there are different ways to interpret the movie. 

Still I would like to know, what is the main story behind Mulholland Drive and what is the most common interpretation of what it is about?

I watched it several times and read the 10 clues that Lynch gave to unlock the riddle, but I still don't think I understand the movie. Is it all a dream? A metaphor? Whats with the character switch? Does the appearance of the strange old couple has something to do with sexual abuse? What about the monster in the alley?

What the hell is going on in Mulholland Drive?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
When movies.stackexchange.com was announced, the very first thing I thought of was "how long after launch before someone asks for an analysis of 'Mulholland Drive'?"

Having said that, here is the very abridged version of what's going on.

The viewer knows a couple of key points:


Rita gets into a car accident and suffers amnesia.
She meets Diane who is trying to become a Hollywood actress.
Mysterious things start to happen and Diane is interested in helping Rita explore/solve those mysteries.


As is typical in Lynch fashion, things begin to become unclear quickly, and there is a definitive point in the movie where things switch around.


  When the box is opened, the perspective changes. Although the viewer
  may not realize it, he is now in the real world, the waking world of
  Diane/Betty. The entire first part of the film, up to the opening of the
  box, has been in Diane/Betty's dream. Betty has ultimately come into contact
  with all of the various people (in real life) that she has seen in her
  dream, and (as is typical with our dreams) faces / events are
  re-arranged, mixed up, and re-associated to form bizarre stories.
  
  
  The opening of the box symbolizes Diane/Betty waking up.
  
  
  The order of events are re-arranged so the we, the viewer, are able to
  piece together the puzzle (ie. Betty coming into contact with a person
  in real-life...who then becomes a face --but an entirely different
  person with different motives--in her dream).


A much more thorough analysis can be found here.
AnswerKenntnis:
Lynch is usually more open to interpretation than most writers/directors and this movie is no exception.

Its not clear that there can ever be a 'completely true' interpretation of Mulholland Drive, but the most commonly discussed idea that is relatively easy to state is that Betty is Diane's dream of a better life.  Putting it in the context of a dream explains away much of the strangeness of some of the plot.  There can be several other postulations - alternate realities, the Wikipedia entry suggests a Mobius strip of time.

I usually like to understand movies, but Mulholland Drive is more to be experienced than explained.

AnswerKenntnis:
The film is also a reimagining of several other movies:


Like The Wizard of Oz, it features a "dream story" where characters in real life populate the landscape of the dream. The two movies also share similar color palettes and set designs:


 


There are two women at the heart of both Mulholland Drive and Persona, one of whom is an actress, who seem to fall in love with each other and to merge their identities slowly:





Among other things, Vertigo shares a scene with Mulholland Drive, where a traumatic event triggers a change in a main character's hair color; there are thematic resonances between the two films as well:





Without wanting to spoil anything, there are also a lot of various female characters posed on a bed in a similar pose building up to a climactic moment for the film:


 


This is probably another Hitchcock reference, this time to Psycho:




Plenty of other films as well.


EDIT: I had the realization recently that what Diane does with characters from her real life, i.e. recontextualize them, is exactly what Mulholland Drive does with prior film history. That's obviously true for many other movies - film history is littered with self-reference - but Mulholland Drive uses its references to an unique purpose. Lynch is also famously interested in dream logic and its relationship to the cinema; it's probably not an accident that some of the most powerful scenes in the movie threaten to (but do not) disrupt not only the fantasia of Diane's dream, but also the suspension of disbelief of an audience watching Mulholland Drive itself. We too are "only" watching a recording just as Betty and Rita are, but like them, we nonetheless feel sincere emotion. And we get a gentle reminder of this same idea when the same campy script that Betty and Rita ridiculed earlier is performed with legitimate heat in her audition scene just before Betty is nearly (but not) introduced to Adam. Adam, of course is creating a movie within a movie, one with a production that features actors lip-synching over recorded music, just like the unnamed woman at Silencio. In the same way that the Wizard in the emerald city at last reveals his machinations to be "just" an illusion, the work of the film director, both in character as Adam, director of The Sylvia North Story, as well as outside as David Lynch, director of Mulholland Drive, are also creators of deceptions. But the power of that illusion is nonetheless also a testament to the power of cinema. "No Hay Banda," sure, but the transportive ability of the film is nonetheless real, and simultaneously an homage to prior shared dreams in a movie theater.
AnswerKenntnis:
What iandotkelly says about Lynch and openness to interpretation in his movies is universally true.

I want to add another interpretation, that I heard. In the second part of the movie Naomi Watts plays a different character. That explanation somewhat reduced my level of confusion about the movie, if you can see both characters as completely separated. But I also like iandotkelly's interpretation.
AnswerKenntnis:
I think there is a lot of metaphysical stuff going on in this movie - something akin to the movie The Sixth Sense with Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis. In that regard, you could say that "Rita" actually died in the car crash and from that point in time, all that happens is imaginary - just as in the aforementioned "Willis" movie. Within this post-death world that we see after the accident, there are deeper levels of it as seen in the scenes with the Cowboy.  Specifically, he is not an embodied or "human" person, rather, he is either an good angel or a bad one and this is further supported by the light bulb flickering on and off just prior to his showing up and again as he departs. Even the glimpse that we see of him at the pool party/engagement party, he is ethereal whereas everyone else in that scene is embodied.  Anyway, this is my take on this enigmatic movie that I saw last night for the very first time.
AnswerKenntnis:
I have my own interpretation of the movie, I haven't shared it with anyone yet, think is about time to do it, since it is quite different from anything I have read so far (and it's been quite some time since the movie opened). I think that what this movie/Lynch is trying to tell us is that God is something like a movie director, casting auditions after a person dies. Depending on the outcome, i.e. if the actor gets the part or not, this person is sent to hell or heaven or even gets another chance in life, the chance to play another part in a movie. In this place, you don't have any recollection of your past, you are given a clean start.

The order of the events is mixed up but note that Diane pays someone to kill Camilla and then commits suicide, so both girls are dead. Camilla dies first so she goes through this "audition" first and apparently doesn't get the part (remember that when Betty auditions, the man there mentions something about a brunette woman that also auditioned), so she is not given another chance, unfortunately. Now recall that in the beginning of the movie, a person is trying to lead  Camilla somewhere that she doesn't want to go but then an accident happens. So instead of being put away since she fails, she is now on the loose.
Diane now is also there, since she committed suicide out of guilt, not long after Camilla was killed. The two women now meet in this place which is something like in-between the real world and hell/heaven, something that shouldn't have happened. Now recall that there was a strange woman living there, kinda spiritual, that freaked out when she saw Camilla and told that "she shouldn't be there".

None of the two women have any recollection of their past life, but at the end, inside the "Silencio" club, they remember everything, this is what the opening of the weird blue box symbolizes. Both women have failed, Diane wakes up by a freaky cowboy in cheap motel, a symbolism for hell. I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I do remember that everything weird could be explained under my assumption.
AnswerKenntnis:
There are alot of people who questioned the meaning behind the blue box. The blue box is indeed Diane waking from her dream but it is much deeper than that. The blue box inturn can actually be considered a pandoras box, Diane/Betty's mental pandoras box also meaning her repressed memories flooding back. If you read about those who have dealt with repressed memories you will see that when the repressed memories come back, they come back in a nausiating and extremely quick fassion. Those who have gone through it know that in that moment it is horrifying, confusing, exciting and ultimately in some ways insane. All they want to do is go back to how it was the moment before the memories re-surfaced or metaphorically meaning to go back inside there own pandoras box unopened and safe. This explains Diane's hysteria and morbid hallucinations that ultimately led her to run into her bedroom and kill herself. Her pandoras box or repressed memories were a way for her to deal with the horrible crime she had commited and once her pandoras box opened and reality was now staring her in the face it was in the end too much for to handle.
AnswerKenntnis:
The Blue Key, btw, has two definitions, one for the dream sequence and one for reality.  

For the dream sequence, the blue key is basically the key to the truth.  Pretty simple.  This may be obvious, but as soon as it's used on the box, we get the true story.

In reality, it's a standard blue key.  The hitman's calling card, kind of.  He uses it to communicate that the job/murder is done, because he doesn't want to be in further contact. 

I wondered why the hitman laughed when Diane asks "what's it open?" But then I figured, as in the dream sequence, again, it opens the truth, in this case, the truth of what Diane has done.  

The hitman knows when a "client" sees the key and  they know the target is dead, that they will probably go through a TON of emotions. It doesn't have to be a key, the emotions will probably be experienced regardless of the item.  But a key amuses the hitman. And maybe he likes to think that a "key" messes with the person's mind more, and maybe it does (fyi, the key doesn't physically open anything).

Also, as a sidenote, we don't know where the hitman left the key, probably NOT on the coffee table. Diane probably just put it there and has been thinking about it. For how long?  Not completely sure but less than three weeks.  The piano ashtray was still there when the neighbor comes by-"c'mon Diane it's been three weeks"- and mentions the "detectives came by again" and it was there when Camilla was alive when they were gettin' freaky on the couch.
AnswerKenntnis:
Havent seen the movie in a bit so can't remember the names. But I think I have a bit of a grasp of whats happening. so the blond girl is in love with the chick with the dark hair rita I think lol but shes jelouse because she has the life she wants. so she gets the hitman and tells him to give the blue box with the key in it to the homeless guy to give to her when she is dead. What the old people and club silencio have to do with it...no idea! Hope that helps.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why is the bride's name bleeped in Kill Bill Vol 1?
qn_description:
In the movie Kill Bill Vol.1, whenever someone mentions the bride by her name


  Beatrix Kiddo


Her name is censored with a beep. Is this explained somewhere in the movie? Or is it just a signature that Tarantino leaves?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Well for the first film and for most of the second, the Bride is on a revenge mission where she is hunting her victims. Her identity would have to be a secret to make sure she doesn't get followed or caught. 

It could be Tarantino's way of breaking the 4th wall and including us in the element of mystery and disguise that the Bride has to undertake to remain anonymous. Also, this could mean we are meant to detached emotionally from her as a character until her name is finally revealed as Beatrix Kiddo by Elle Driver. 

This is when we see the character as fully vulnerable and when she opens up her emotions. So Tarantino thought of this as the opportune moment to unveil all secrets of this character. 

Or perhaps it was just Tarantino being weird and awesome.
AnswerKenntnis:
From the script:


  


From an interview with Uma Thurman:


  Why do they bleep your name? 
  
  That one eludes me. You'll find out her name. You will definitely find out her name, I can tell you right now, but that'd ruin it. 


From an interview with Vivica A. Fox:


  What name do you and Uma say when they bleep it out?
  
  Beatrix. Her name is Beatrix. It is weird right? Even when I saw the screening of it the other day I thought, ΓÇ£Are people going to get that?ΓÇ¥ You never hear her name. SheΓÇÖs just The Bride. Whenever I go, ΓÇ£Sweetie this is an old friend of mommyΓÇÖs, Beatrix, Beatrix, this is my daughter,ΓÇ¥ itΓÇÖs bleeps. And she goes, ΓÇ£Hi honey, my name isΓÇªΓÇ¥ and it bleeps. See, youΓÇÖve got to go see it again. 
  
  Why does he do that?
  
  Because he wants you to come back and see it again and figure out what the hell her name is. Just to add little things. Just a quirk.


There were several hints about the name, giving people the opportunity to figure it out before it was eventually revealed in Volume 2.

For example, when she buys a plane ticket to Japan her name is visible on the boarding pass:


  




Where did the name Beatrix Kiddo come from?

From an interview with Quentin Tarantino:


  Uma came up with the name Beatrix -- she worked for somebody with that name. And I came up with Kiddo. That's what I call women -- when I really like a girl, I call her "kiddo".




Speculation:

Quentin Tarantino is a known fan of Jean-Luc Godard (his production company A Band Apart was named after Godard's movie Bande ├á part).

In Godard's movie Made in the U.S.A. there is a running gag:


  Godard censors RichardΓÇÖs second name with all kinds of sounds possible. 


So maybe this was Tarantino's inspiration.
AnswerKenntnis:
Her name is bleeped because she cannot be named until she deserves to. Throughout the film she has 4 names. In chronological order the first event of the story is the wedding massacre. At this point she is Black Mamba. She is shot in the head by Bill. This is the death of Black Mamba. She wakes up four years later. This is the birth of The Bride. Now The Brides sole purpose is to take up the sword and wreak havoc on those who wronged her. She kills O-Ren with the sword and Vernita with a knife.

She becomes dependent on the sword. So much so that she underestimates Budd. Her plan is of course to attack Budd in his trailer with the sword. This immediately backfires when Budd shoots her with rock salt and disarms her. What happens next is the most significant part of the film. Having her sword taken away from her she is now powerless. Budd nails her in a wooden coffin and buries her alive. This is the death of The Bride. It is during this burial that through remembering her training with Pai Mei she realizes she doesn't need to rely on the sword. Her power lies in her hands.

She punches her way out of the coffin. This is the birth of Beatrix Kiddo. From here on her name will not be bleeped and she will not use the sword again. Beatrix doesn't kill Budd, Elle Driver does. Beatrix snatches Elle's other eye out leaving her completely blind. It is questioned in the end credits whether Elle dies or not as she is left blind in Budd's trailer with a deadly Black Mamba snake. After this, only Bill is left. She tracks him down ready to kill him when suddenly she is killed. Well symbolically of course. She is shocked at the sudden realization that her daughter is still alive. Her daughter shoots her with a toy gun. Beatrix falls to the ground (dies) and is woken up by B.B. (her daughter). 

She is reborn as "Mommy".
AnswerKenntnis:
An explanation based on secrecy from other characters isn't self-consistent or internally consistent. She is hunting people who know who she is and beeping the name for the audience doesn't stop the characters knowing who she is (the name isn't beeped for the characters but for the audience). And the people she is hunting know they are being hunted by her.

Careful attention to what characters say to her before her name is revealed to the audience, however, suggests a different explanation. Several times she is referred to as "kiddo" by other characters, especially Bill, which the audience will interpret as a term of endearment if they don't know her name is Kiddo. They can then reinterpret the earlier scenes when the real name is revealed. 

This subtle misdirection seems a plausible motivation for Tarantino.
AnswerKenntnis:
I thought it was a humorously heavy-handed ploy to evoke Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name" character in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western films.
AnswerKenntnis:
It's basically just a reference to 'Made In U.S.A' and...that's pretty much it. That's the only reason anything happens in that movie; it's just there to remind you of another movie.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why does Harry only make use of time travel in The Prisoner of Azkaban?
qn_description:
At the end of The Prisoner of Azkaban,
Harry and Hermione travel back in time to save Sirius (and as it turns out, Buckbeak) and escape the Dementors.

If this is a legitimate option for saving people, why don't they ever use it again? If they can use it to save Sirius in The Prisoner of Azkaban, why can't they use it to save him when he dies in The Order of the Phoenix? For that matter, why can't they go back to the beginning and kill Tom Riddle before he becomes Voldemort?

The only thing I can think of is that in The Prisoner of Azkaban, maybe they use the Time Turner before Sirius is given to the Dementors, and so they're not actually saving him from something that already happened; they're altering a series of events that they know will lead up to him being handed over to the Dementors. Is that how time travel works in Harry Potter land? That is, you can't alter something as definitive as death (or a Dementor's kiss), but you can alter other events that have occurred and consequently prevent a death that you know will occur?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
From what I remember about the books and the films, Hermione only gets given the Time Turner device in her third year at Hogwarts. She was given it, with the permission of the Ministry of Magic, so that she could attend two sets of lessons at once.

In this link, you can see that she stated that the pressure of using it to do twice as much work became too stressful, so she returned the device to the ministry. In the following year, all the devices were destroyed during the battle at the ministry, so it was not possible to use the device again. I am therefore guessing that the art of creating such a device was lost in the years since they were first made.
AnswerKenntnis:
I'm not going to repeat the excellent plot oriented answers - but its my opinion that JKR probably realized that freely available and controllable time travel can critically damage your ability to make a problem that cannot be simply resolved by the protagonist.  Magic itself has that problem too - but at least she can put limits on the magic and the fact that other characters in the story have magic too which cancels out some of the power that gives Harry & co.

This is exactly why (most) of the stories that include time travel that I can think of involve plot points to make it unpredictable or uncontrollable or simply hard to do:


Back to the Future (1.21 gigawatts of power or it is broken)
Dr. Who (the Tardis is broken and hard to control, and for one whole period grounded entirely)
Star Trek (its always some accident or external issue - though magically they always get to return ok)
The Time Tunnel (i seem to recall that there is an accident with it)
The Time Machine (he passes out when using it and ends up going too far)
AnswerKenntnis:
From reading the books I'd say that in a sense a Time-Turner can't really be used to change the past at all. In The Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry and Hermione use the Time-Turner around midnight to travel back three hours in time, endeavoring to save Sirius and Buckbeak. However, everything they do in these three hours has already happened:


At the end of Chapter 16, there's "the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe" (followed by Hagrid's howling). Later we learn that this was not the executioner killing Buckbeak, but the executioner swinging his axe into the fence in anger.
At the end of Chapter 20, Harry, Hermione and Sirius are saved from the dementors by the Patronus that the back-in-time Harry conjured, and the "real" Harry sees his "future" self patting the Patronus (believing that he sees his father).
Only in Chapter 21 they use the Time-Turner. I'd say they have to use it since they had already taken influence on the past, as described in the previous two bullet points – their travelling back in time had already happened.


Thus, the answer to your question is: When you use a Time-Turner, you can alter only events that you have no definitive knowledge of. (Everything Harry and Hermione do is 100% consistent with what they had already experienced first-hand.) In particular, you can't go back to the beginning and kill Tom Riddle before he becomes Voldemort.
AnswerKenntnis:
I can not recall exactly where or when but I vividly remember that Dumbledore once told Harry that playing with time can be a very dangerous act and it can trap the time abuser in something like a Time Loop (for whatever it is!).  

But in my own opinion time traveling is one those matters that if not dealt with correctly and thoroughly can become one of those weak points of the story and obviously it is a weak point in the Harry Potter series.
AnswerKenntnis:
If just say Harry had travelled back to when Tom Riddle was young and killed him, Harry would have no way of getting back to the present time as it appears the Time Turner only allows people to go back and no forward. This would result in Harry being old by the time he is supposed to be in Hogwarts. 

So if this was to work then one individual would have to sacrifice their life in the present time for a life in the past.
AnswerKenntnis:
Here's a hypothesis since it is in stated in the book. I believe even with magic a person cannot go back in time before their birth. Also may be the time turner is simply a magical object that isn't as powerful enough to move far back in time.

But thats just hypothesis, only real facts is that it has mental effects on the user. Like Hermione getting stressed or Dumbledore warning that the wearer cannot let the past self see their future counterpart otherwise they can get crazy.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why aren't the characters floating two levels down?
qn_description:
If level 0 is reality, the characters in the van are at level 1.  The van drops off the edge of the bridge, and goes into freefall.  At level 2, in the hotel, they experience the freefall as well.  But then, at level 3, at the fortress, (and for that matter, in limbo) there is no freefall.  Why?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
It is slightly odd, because other senses appear to be able to penetrate more than one layer, although they are severely attenuated.

For example, when they are in Level 2 - someone says "did you feel that, was that turbulence on the plane" (which is Level 0), to which Eames says "no, too close, Yusuf's driving probably".  He doesn't say - "of course not, you wouldn't feel anything down here, must be Yusuf's driving".  Then there is the Edith Piaf song used to synchronize the kick.  That is played by Yusuf into Arthur's ears in Level 1, yet is heard (faintly) in Level 3.  Then there is the 'second kick' that they experience when the van hits the water, this is felt in Level 3 - showing that something should be felt of the free-fall even at that layer.

If senses are attenuated with each layer it would be more realistic to think that somewhat less than free-fall would be experienced in Level 2, and some effect would be experienced in Level 3.  There is too much discrepancy between the total free-fall experienced by Arthur, and the apparent normality of skiing down a mountain that the team experience in Level 3.

Still doesn't spoil my enjoyment of it though.
AnswerKenntnis:
Best explanation is the time mechanic.  Because time and other physics means for so little that deep, it could be that they are just deep enough that they do not feel it.  Briefly going over the scenes of the movie, they appear to be strapped down in order to not cause this free-fall effect.

A more simpler explanation is that it is just an oversight on Nolan's part.
AnswerKenntnis:
The freefall was to wake them up from the next level (so they would feel it!)

This is how I see the "falling" happen:



Level 1: Van falling


Felt at Level 2  




Level 3 feels nothing -- can get stuck.  




How is this remedied?
Freefall on level 2 which will bring them back from level 3.


Ok Back from level 3 up to level 2 with freefall 

Back up to level 1 with van freefall


Back up to level 0 with main freefall
AnswerKenntnis:
I think because when the van drives off the bridge in level 1, that is the 'kick' for the hotel level. When JGL activates the kick in the elevator, they feel it in the snow level.
AnswerKenntnis:
Perhaps this can be explained by assuming that (1) a controlled mental projection only has enough power to travel down one level and (2) a kick is designed to travel up, not down. The first premise is supported by noting that Yusuf is the dream controller for level 1, and his need to visit the men's room at level 0 causes rain at level 1 but not level 2. Arthur is the dream controller for level 2, and his free fall at level 1 causes free fall in level 2 but not level 3. Premise (2) relies on the idea that the purpose of a kick is to wake up all of the extractors at level 0. You may have experienced something like this when you are having a nightmarish dream and something extremely violent happens in the dream that causes you to suddenly sit up in bed. If you think about a kick as originating inside the dream and travelling upwards, its downward effects (if any) become irrelevant other than as a warning that all of the dreams are about to end. It seems that each level needs an upwards kick since Arthur scrambles around setting up a kick with the elevator at level 2. Not sure why lower levels need an upwards kick, a level 1 to level 0 kick should suffice.
QuestionKenntnis:
What significance does Mike Yanagita have in Fargo?
qn_description:
In the Coen brothers' movie "Fargo" the detective Marge Gunderson gets called by and meets an old schoolmate, Mike Yanagita. He tells her that he is widowed and tries to make a move on her. 

Later she finds out that he lied about being married and that he actually is a failed existence, a man who lives with his parents and has psychological problems.

The character of Mike Yanagita seems to be a side plot and does not add to the main plot of Fargo, the kidnapping and the consequent crimes, in any way.

So why did the Coen brothers put this character in? Is the subplot just there to give a better picture of one of the main characters, Marge? Is it supposed to explain the moral of the movie, which I think was "money does not bring you happiness"? Or does this character have any significance to the movie, that I am missing?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
The "Mike Yaganita" subplot is discussed on the Subplot Screenwriting Tips page, and a blog commenter writes: (Source: Kathleen A. Ryan)


  Every time my husband and I watch FARGO (we own the DVD, & are huge
  Coen bros. fans), we have the same conversation about the purpose of
  the subplot you mention. My guess, however, is this: Marge is
  presented as an intelligent cop; however, she can be very trusting and
  slightly naive about the nature of people. She bought MikeΓÇÖs story,
  and was shocked after learning Mike lied (and so convincingly). This,
  in turn, propels her to return to Jerry (because maybe he lied,
  tooΓÇªand the evidence does point to that business). Without this scene,
  what would have prompted Marge to reinterview Jerry? Her instincts are
  confirmed when he ΓÇ£flees the interview.ΓÇ¥ (IΓÇÖm a retired cop, and I
  love that scene).


This was further clarified by blog commenter Joshua Christopher Mills who wrote:


  Great article, by the way. I wouldnΓÇÖt fault anyone on missing the
  point of the Mike Yanagita subplot (I know I didnΓÇÖt get it for a long
  time), so I think the observation we need to take away from Fargo is,
  perhaps, clarity. Even though the subplot does have a specific, solid,
  necessary purpose, it ends up confusing a lot of viewers because it
  appears unnecessary. The last thing you want to do is lose the audienceΓÇôluckily the scenes with Mike Yanagita are funny and
  well-written, a definite testament to the CoenΓÇÖs skillΓÇôbut most
  writers arenΓÇÖt the Coen brothers.


IMHO, a spot-on analysis. In short, the character/subplot exists to demonstrate to the viewer that she's too trusting of people.
AnswerKenntnis:
From an interview with Richard Kelly (writer/director of Donnie Darko):


  Can you explain the character of Cherita [Chen]?
  
  I like to call her my ΓÇÿMike Yanagita.ΓÇÖ Remember Mike Yanagita from ΓÇ£Fargo?ΓÇ¥ He hits on Frances McDormand at the Radisson. They have Diet Cokes at the Radisson and he comes on to her.
  
  If the Coen Bros. didnΓÇÖt have final cut, a studio executive would have demanded that they cut that scene because it doesnΓÇÖt make sense, it doesnΓÇÖt contribute to the plot. But if you really pay attention to ΓÇ£Fargo,ΓÇ¥ that scene is really pivotal to Frances McDormandΓÇÖs character because when she finds out that Mike Yanagita is completely lying about his wife dying, that it was a complete lie, sheΓÇÖs just shocked that she could have been lied to. SheΓÇÖs such a trustworthy person and it makes her go back to William H. MacyΓÇÖs car lot to question him again. 
  
  So the Mike Yanagita scene is actually really, really important on a character level. On a plot level, itΓÇÖs superfluous and itΓÇÖs just the Coen Bros. just being weird or self-indulgent maybe. But I think itΓÇÖs a great pivotal scene for character reasons and I think thatΓÇÖs probably what they thought, too. 
  
  Using that metaphor for Cherita Chen, she contributes nothing to the plot at all. She is extraneous and superfluous, but that moment where Donnie is wearing the earmuffs couldnΓÇÖt exist were it not for Cherita Chen. That is a very important character moment.


From an interview with Frances McDormand:


  [The Coen Bros.] told me they wanted to develop MargeΓÇÖs character in a different context, other than with her husband, or with the murder case. Any character developmentΓÇöthatΓÇÖs good. So when they come up with this Mike Yanagita sceneΓÇöI didnΓÇÖt really get it until I saw the finished movie.
  
  [...]
  
  In that scene with Mike Yanagita, she realized he was lying. ThatΓÇÖs the biggest thing she has to accept, because at the end when she talks about greed and not understanding why these guys did what they did, thatΓÇÖs just MargeΓÇÖs general condition.
AnswerKenntnis:
I think she's a little more Columbo than Mason (and I just happened to reach it as I also have a copy). I think she is flattered when Mike calls her because she makes a side trip to meet him while on business in the Twin Cities, and when she goes into the restraunt to meet him for lunch, she makes a point of straightening out her clothes (the most feminine and prettiest wardrobe she wears in the whole movie) and smooths her hair. She's obviously happy to see him and called him back to make the date as she got the restraunt info from the hotel staff.

Although her husband Norm is sweet and attentive, he does seem a little dull and at 6 months 7 months pregnant, Marge may also be looking for a little validation. But, she's quick enough to pick up on Mike's insecurities and talk with her girlfriend to uncover the truth.

I think what leads her to Jerry's office is simply a follow-up question on the Dealer plates questions. The car must have been stolen from a dealership.

But in the end, she got her man!
AnswerKenntnis:
I agree with the comment that Mike's convincing lying points out to Marge that Jerry may be lying too, and so the second interview with Jerry, where Jerry becomes less and less convincing ("I'm cooperating here") under Marge's polite but insistent questioning.

But I think there is something else.  Consider the consecutive scenes where the criminals are banging the TV and yelling obscenities at it, followed by Marge and Norm calmly watching a show where insects prepares for birth by storing food, followed by the phone call from Mike.  The next day, she decides to go to the Twin Cities, a four hour drive from Brainerd.  Notice how surprised Norm is, and notice how she doesn't tell him about Mike.  Does she really have to go to the Twin Cities?  Not really, a state trooper was killed, the state police would be all over this investigation.  She is going to see Mike, who she knew and liked in high school, and who she may feel would be a better provider for her and her child than the virtually unemployed Norm. The investigation is a convenient cover (and pays the expenses) for the trip.

Of course, when she gets there, she realizes that something is wrong with Mike, she cuts the meeting short, and next morning she calls her girl friend in the Twin Cities to find out.  She is surprised  to find that everything Mike said was a lie, and he is a mess in general.  Which leads her back to Jerry, who is even more of mess.

At the end of the movie, again watching TV in bed, Marge learns that Norm sold a painting to the Postal Service, so some money will be coming.  So Marge now feels they are doing pretty well (she may not have felt that before).  So the point of the sub-plot - it is better to do the lawful thing, rather than be tempted to circumvent the law - reflects the point of the main plot, which is the same point exaggerated by the complete stupidity of the criminals and the magnitude and violence of their crimes.

What kind of company is Initech?
qn_description:
What kind of company is Initech in the movie Office Space?

There are a few important things we know about Initech that the movie plot hinged on.  Are there any real-life companies that actually fit this criteria?


Initech hires computer programmers that "update bank software for the 2000 switch"
Initech has access to "the credit union software"
Initech has access to "the credit union mainframe"
Initech's accounting department notices when the money goes missing
Initech has a "Corporate Accounts Payable" department (although at least one transcriber disagrees with me and thinks it's "Corporate Councils Payroll")
Initech has a "Logistics" department
Initech has engineers who lack people skills sufficient to interface directly with their customers.


Items 1,2,7 make Initech sound like a software development house that contracts with financial institutions.  Item 3 additionally makes Initech sound like a company that contracts with financial institutions for server and software maintenance.

Item 4 makes Initech sound like the actual financial institution.

Item 5 sounds more like a consulting firm, as I think "accounts payable" is more likely simply called "loans"; but an actual banker could probably clear this up.

Item 6 could probably be either a bank or a consulting firm.

I would think maybe Initech is simply a subsidiary of a large financial corporation, that does in-house IT consulting and programming for the parent company.  But item 7 doesn't fit with this theory, as then there wouldn't be any real "customers" (in a traditional sense).

So... What kind of company is Initech? :)
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Initech is ostensibly a software company, but I don't think it could really exist.  I'll take your points one at a time.


Initech hires computer programmers that "update bank software for the 2000 switch"

This would fit either a bank/credit union, or a software consulting company.
Initech has access to "the credit union software"

Again, this would fit both.  Programmers at a consulting company absolutely need access to the source code in order to make changes.
Initech has access to "the credit union mainframe"

Access to the mainframe pretty much eliminates "consulting company."  I happen to work as a programmer at a bank through a consulting company.  There's no way any bank or credit union is going to give access to a consultant to run unchecked code on any system where it could cause harm.
Initech's accounting department notices when the money goes missing

This also eliminates "software consulting company" from consideration.  A consulting company has their own accounting department that would track expenses and income for their own activities, not those of their customers.  The bank or credit union would notice the money goes missing, not Initech.
Initech has a "Corporate Accounts Payable" department (although at least one transcriber disagrees with me and thinks it's "Corporate Councils Payroll")

This doesn't offer much information.  "Accounts Payable" is a common accounting term that any company would use.  Any kind of loan or purchase on credit would be recorded under accounts payable.  A banker would refer to it as a loan, but an accountant (or accounting software) might still call it by the more generic term.
Initech has a "Logistics" department

This could go either way.  A bank would have a logistics department, but so might a consulting company that worked for a bank.
Initech has engineers who lack people skills sufficient to interface directly with their customers.

Any company with an IT department has those.  In programming, a "customer" might be anyone who uses our software.  They can be internal or external to the company.  In my department we call the quants and bank officers who use our software to make investment decisions our customers.  Other departments write software for actual bank customers (people with checking or savings accounts).  Many of us don't talk directly with our customers.  Instead we communicate through a project manager or other intermediary.


Given all of this, I think your guess of "subsidiary of a large financial corporation" isn't far off.  I think #4 would still eliminate a subsidiary company though.  It's unlikely that the same subsidiary would handle both software development and accounting for the parent company.  So in summary, Initech appears to be some kind of amalgam of a bank and a software consulting company that doesn't exist in the real world.
AnswerKenntnis:
I used to work at a software company that created products to run mid to high-end credit unions.  (Taking care of pretty much all software needs.)  It was also rumored to serve as the inspiration for Office Space, though I would imagine this is a rumor at many companies.  


"Initech hires computer programmers that "update bank software for the 2000 switch""
I'm pretty sure some adjustments were made and tests were performed, just like they were everywhere. 
"Initech has access to "the credit union software""
The company I worked for had complete control of the code running on client systems.
"Initech has access to "the credit union mainframe""
Our clients would allow us to log on to their mainframe systems.  Some clients would restrict what we could see, but most just let us see everything.  At the time I worked there, many to most clients would keep a modem line available at all times that we could use to log in.  Everything was logged, so if you changed something you would probably get caught, but you could do it.
"Initech's accounting department notices when the money goes missing"
The company I worked at wouldn't have had any reports like that, but the credit unions would generally do a nightly balancing and if something was off, we would CERTAINLY hear about it, usually even before business opening. (So the needed transactions could be reversed/fixed/etc)  Having Initech notice probably makes the plot easier to follow, however.
"Initech has a "Corporate Accounts Payable" department (although at least one transcriber disagrees with me and thinks it's "Corporate Councils Payroll")"  No idea here.  I suspect this was required by the plot once you had Initech being the one that notices the money is missing. 
"Initech has a "Logistics" department."  Most any company can have one of these. The place I worked certainly had people working on logistics. 
"Initech has engineers who lack people skills sufficient to interface directly with their customers."  We did not work directly with customers, but this was less because of a lack of people skills and more because engineer time cost more than customer service time and most issues could be resolved without programmers getting involved.  Often on-call situations resulted in programmers interacting directly with customers, however.
AnswerKenntnis:
"Initech" is pretty much "any tech" company.
AnswerKenntnis:
For several years I worked for a consulting company developing software for what's called a "correspondent bank" - i.e., an intermediary that processes transactions on behalf of other banks. Customer banks are called "respondent banks".  

It's possible that Initech did something similar. I could make the following observations:


Our customer (the correspondent or 'host' bank) would balance transaction totals to ensure that everything added up correctly.  We as the consulting company did not have access to production data and did not perform this task.
We generally did not work directly with software from RBs (our customer's customers), but we did work directly with other systems in-house with our customer, some of which were commercial off-the-shelf products; for example, message queueing and/or GL accounting or core processing systems.
AnswerKenntnis:
I always thought of Initech as a financial transaction intermediary that did custom implementations on either end of the connections they were facilitating.  This could be, for example, Credit Union to Credit Card company or Credit Union to Check Clearinghouse, etc...  Not 100% sure as I've never developed software that close to financial transaction processing, but it seems feasible to me.
AnswerKenntnis:
I worked at Intel at the time and the similarities were so great that I assumed Initech = Intel.  Not specifically, but a play on words with a company everyone knows that they figured had the same undesireable cubicle culture.  I figured they made the line of work different to not get sued.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why is there no Robin in the Nolan-directed Batman movies?
qn_description:
Although Robin seems to have an pivotal role in ruining earlier Batman movies, he's still an integral part of the Batman series.   Is there a reason why Robin does not appear in Batman Begins/The Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
It's a matter of the director having a specific vision of how his Batman stories will become. In the first two films, Christopher Nolan wanted to bring Batman back to his roots, explore how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and how Batman became the legend he is (in the 1989 Batman film, when Vicki Vale asks Bruce why bats, he replies "They're great survivors"; in Batman Forever, we get a VERY brief glimpse of bats on Bruce's mind. That's all the motivation we get). Batman Begins was very much an origin story, showing also the training Bruce took to become Batman. The Dark Knight follows soon after that story, as the ending of Batman Begins sets up The Joker to enter the story.

The thing is, I tried looking up the reason, and I can't yet find any quotes online from Christopher Nolan (see this article here for an expanded story on this). The next film, The Dark Knight Rises, supposedly takes place 8 years after The Dark Knight. It also features Bane, a character who became notorious for eventually breaking Batman's back. It's entirely conceivable that Nolan will include Robin in this film as his protege who can help him fight Bane. Nobody outside the film set really knows. Me, I'm looking forward to finding out in 2012.
AnswerKenntnis:
Robin is in the final Nolan directed Batman movie ("The Dark Knight Rises").  In the final few minutes of the movie, when Officer Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is collecting his property from the boys home, the woman behind the desk isn't able to find his name in their system.  He then gives her is 'real name,' after which she says "You should use your real name, I like it better (or something to that nature) . . . Robin."

The interesting part about the conclusion of the Dark Knight Rises is that it seems to be a set up for a "Robin" franchise in the next few years.  When Officer Blake discovers the batcave beneath Wayne Manor (Now the new home for Gotham's Orphans) it seems to be a 'passing of the torch' moment. Also when he is talking with Bruce Wayne about the similarities of their pasts, and at the end of the movie when he is talking with Gordon about why he is leaving the police force (i.e. the 'structure'). In fact, during the first thirty minutes of the movie, there even seems to be a set-up for who the villian will be for Robin . . . Killer-Croc.  When Commisioner Gordon is taken captive by Bane in the sewers, there is a brief mention by one of the officers of a "large crocadial" (or something using those terms) in the sewers.  I beleive that Killer-Croc spent the majority of his time in the sewers in the comic series.  It seemed like an off the cuff kind of statment for a character, and pointless to have in the movie, since it's humor factor didn't really have too much of an impact.  I honestly believe it was a direct set up line for a Robin movie.
AnswerKenntnis:
Christian Bale said that he wouldn't want to be Batman in this franchise if there was a Robin and Christopher Nolan obliged. Nolan said that he wouldn't fit the dark tone of the movies. Also Dick Grayson is very young when he becomes Robin, about 10 or 12. So that's another reason for not having him in the films.
AnswerKenntnis:
Nolan has given an explanation for this. According to him the Batman portrayed in his movies is still young and according to comics Robin appears only when Batman grows old and hence needs a sidekick. Nolan has also said that in his trilogy Robin won't appear at all because these movies will present a young Batman.
AnswerKenntnis:
To keep it short:   

The point of the Robin reference was to display that even though the audience did not know Blake was Robin, he still was. In some interview, someone close to the production of the movie mentioned how the purpose is that he was Robin the whole time, you only find out at the end. This represents perfectly what Batman says to Blake earlier in DKR, that his goal was only to inspire people. The purpose of Batman is not that only Batman can do it. 

The message is that anyone has the ability to stand up for justice and protect his or her society. Some of the true heroes of the day are Gordon, Blake, and Selina (Selina actually SAVES Batman when Bane is about to kill him at the end of the movie). Making a Robin movie would veer away from the purpose and just present another hero of Gotham, while, conversely, the hero of Gotham is the soul of hope. And that belongs to anyone.
AnswerKenntnis:
Batman will be rebooted to fit in with the new DC Universe leading up to an eventual Justice League movie that has been green lighted after the success of Marvel's Avengers. It will not be confirmed until after the Superman reboot that's coming next year. So there was no time to introduce Robin as the Franchise had to go to make way for what they expect to be a bigger movie, believe it or not considering the success of Nolan's Batman franchise.

That being said, and after watching the ending of the TDKR... they're obviously toying with the idea of a Robin or Nightwing franchise in the Nolan "realistic" Universe because it is such a wildly popular adaptation.

I expect to see a spin-off Franchise dealing with how Robin becomes Nightwing in a few years. Otherwise what was the point of that ending?
AnswerKenntnis:
He is in The Dark Night Rises with the cover name 


   John Blake who is a rookie cop and a big fan of Wayne and "Batman". He also knew from when he was a kid that Wayne is The Batman.


In the final scene you hear a woman asking why he does not go by his real name, and then calls him "Robin".
QuestionKenntnis:
Do Sheldon's equations reflect real math/physics research?
qn_description:
In the first season the equations on Sheldon's whiteboard change over time and in each episode there's a different equation; so they put someone in charge to show that there's actually a progress in that board. 

But it's a real progress research or those equations reflect something already solid or demonstrated? 

Here's a photo with Sheldon, Penny and the whiteboard in the background:
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
As a mere viewer of The Big Bang Theory, I can't answer this question with certainty, but as a physicist, I can offer a couple observations:


The equations that appear on the whiteboards in TBBT are from widely varied fields of physics and chemistry. They cover a much wider scope than a typical scientist would actually be working on. Of course, Sheldon is not your typical scientist, and I suppose he could be doing some sort of highly cross-disciplinary research incorporating many different subfields of physics, but still, all the various equations don't seem to have much of a logical connection. Anyway, given that Sheldon considers pretty much anything other than string theory to be beneath him, I can't really see him getting involved in that kind of project on a regular basis.
Many of the equations I recognize as well-established physics, the kind of thing one learns as a beginning graduate student. This doesn't necessarily mean anything by itself, because all research is based on well-established physics, but if the equations on the boards were meant to reflect actual current research projects, I would expect to be going "huh, what's that?" and looking things up a lot more often than I do. The BBT blog discusses some reasons why it's generally not practical to incorporate actual current research into the show.
There's one particular scene that may be relevant to this: Leslie is over at the guys' apartment (sleeping with Leonard I think), and overnight she fixes an error in Sheldon's math on the whiteboard which he had been struggling with for some time. The thing is, the particular calculation Sheldon was doing (deriving the QCD beta function from renormalization of gluon-exchange diagrams, IIRC) is something that was first worked out back in the 1970s and has been standard physics ever since. It should have been utterly trivial for Sheldon, as an accomplished string theorist (and genius) to do this properly, so I just have  hard time believing that he'd been struggling with it. Even if he were, it would not have been hard for him to just look up the proper method and locate the error that way (perhaps his pride prevented him from doing that, but then again a big part of becoming a successful physicist is being able to look things up).


So in summary, I'd say almost certainly no, the equations do not in general reflect current progress in research (though the latest couple blog entries on the show's blog suggest that they're trying this). But they are at a much higher level than most other instances of math in movies and TV, and they are actual scientific equations, so you have to give the show credit for that.
AnswerKenntnis:
The person you write about, the consultant, UCLA Professor David Saltzberg, has a blog that explains the mathematics of the show episodes. Giving a quick glance, it appears there is an entry for each episode that explains the scientific theme(s) brought up during the show. None of the few I read say anything about progression of the math through a series of episodes. They all seem to be standalone; I can't discern a continuity.
AnswerKenntnis:
In the bonus material of season 1 or 2, there is this item about the scientist who provides these equations and the material for it. I remember he said that the problems that are written down, are recent problems that are brought up/solved in recent papers in the respective fields of Sheldon/Leonard/Raj.
AnswerKenntnis:
Ok, I have no sources right here right now, but I remember that in first season it was some kind of "progression" on his work... or, more than progression a "connection". But don't take this show too serious, specially not after season 2, a lot of things are just a random mix of  disconnected thoeries, hypothesis, etc.
AnswerKenntnis:
Continuity wise I would say it's a fair attempt to find legitimacy among learned viewers but to the majority of the masses who have justified the shows popularity the actual math is irrelevant compared to the continues comic relief the show offers amongst the supposed serious work. If you can, try not to over think the show as for example how Leonard has in his relationship with Penny you may enjoy it more. On a related topic Mayim Bialik who plays Amy Farrah Fowler on the show has earned an undergraduate degree in neuroscience and Hebrew and Jewish studies and has probable moved on to advanced studies. She's also written a book about parenting based on the science of hormones involved in parent-child bonding, to be released by Simon & Schuster. Her Ph.D. research at UCLA focused on obsessive compulsive disorder among people with Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition in which the hypothalamus malfunctions. What a gal.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why does George Mcfly employ Biff to wax his car after he had previously tried to rape his wife?
qn_description:
In Back to the Future, Marty goes back to 1955 and devises a plan for his father George McFly to win over Lorraine in order to ensure Marty's survival.

The plan involved Marty pretending to sexually assault Lorraine then George would step in and stop him. Biff meddles with Marty's plan, by kicking Marty out of the car and then he tries to rape Lorraine. George expecting to find Marty in the car, instead finds Biff and musters the courage to stop Biff and protect Lorraine.

Near the end of the movie when Marty travels back to 1985 we see that Biff is outside of Marty's house waxing George's car. Why would George employ Biff to do this job? I can't imagine Lorraine would be too happy with the idea.
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
I haven't seen any director commentary, so I can't speak with full authority.

However, I don't think they thought that hard about it.  I think it is put in there for dramatic effect.

The antagonist was defeated, and now instead of the big man on campus, he practically begs from George McFly for work.  It is a triumph of the little guy over his oppressor.

The movie is full of David vs Goliath moments, and that's when you know the underdog ultimately won.
AnswerKenntnis:
It's not clear that Biff was trying to rape Loraine.  Although he was clearly taking liberties he should not have.
McFly subdued Biff in the fight at the dance.  After that, Biff learned to take his place behind McFly.  The car-waxing scene was really just to prove this.
30 years had passed.  The new, wiser McFly was undoubtedly able to forgive Biff--especially with Biff in his new subordinate role.
AnswerKenntnis:
We're talking about a movie filmed in 1985 set in the year 1955. People's attitudes towards consent were different back then. For example, no one, at least not at the time, would say John Travolta was trying to rape Olivia Newton-John in Grease.
AnswerKenntnis:
I don't think he employed him (as in, offering him money for doing it). I think it is more that he commanded him to do it, that is, he's now the one who can get Biff to do things for him, and Biff no longer has the balls to refuse.
AnswerKenntnis:
For all we know, in the intervening years, Biff saw the error of his ways, begged forgiveness, and was accepted by the McFlys as a changed man.
AnswerKenntnis:
Have you ever noticed how feminine Biff's character is in the new 1985? The assumption the audience is being invited to make is that, because he was so completely emasculated in his encounter with George McFly the night of the dance, Biff eventually became a homosexual. This explains why George McFly doesn't consider it a risk to keep him around the house despite his past misdeeds.
AnswerKenntnis:
In the book version, it makes it clear that Biff was, indeed, trying to rape Lorraine. When he sees her in the car after threatening to take the damage to his own car out of Marty's ass, he says (in the book) "Maybe I'll take part of it outta your ass."

The book then goes on to say, after Marty is locked in the Starlighters' car trunk, that Marty was kicking himself, figuratively speaking, for the fact that "if it hadn't been for him, Lorraine would be inside enjoying the dance instead of having to fight to avoid being raped".
QuestionKenntnis:
Did Tyler Durden forget his name?
qn_description:
Ed Norton plays the Narrator or Jack ( due to reading a book that described someone called Jack's body parts from a 1st person perspective).  Meanwhile Brad Pitt is introduced as Tyler Durden. Later on we find out that they are the same person.

So is Tyler Durden the new name he has chosen which he went and made an ID for and got various part-time jobs under or is it his original name and he somehow keeps blanking it out when he needs to tell police (things like his apartment exploded, or that other things will explode) or when he sees it on his checks from work or his work documents Id and many other things that would have his name on them?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
In addition to Orion's answer, I'd add that while it's not specifically stated in the movie, I think it's implied well enough that the Narrator's name is not Tyler Durden. Tyler says at one point that the Narrator is "slowly letting himself become Tyler Durden." If his name was actually Tyler, this line wouldn't make any sense.

I suspect the movie avoids telling us his real name as a clue that he and Tyler are the same person. It was very clever indeed.

I still remember the first time I watched it and Marla is asking him his name, "What's your name? It's not on your card. Is it Radith? Corneleus? Any of the stupid names you give each night?" The bus passes in front of her, ending the scene so we don't get to hear the Narrator's answer . . . and it didn't phase me one bit. It just seemed like a neat way to end the scene.

Fight Club is definitely one of my top ten movies of all time.
AnswerKenntnis:
Since Ed developed Tyler as part of his split personality a.k.a. Dissociative identity disorder. Then all memories of Tyler are actually his with his mind filling in the logical holes in the memory. So Tyler looks and acts like a separate person with all the accessories that would make the separate person.

It is not until the end that the two personalities become "aware" of each other. At this point the memories merge and the personalities become one.
AnswerKenntnis:
This appears to be intentionally ambiguous on the part of the author. From an interview with author Chuck Palahniuk:


  What exactly IS the name of the main character in Fight Club, is his name Tyler, Jack, or something else? 
  
  His name was never given in the book. They needed a name for the screenplay to put next to the character's lines so they just put Jack in there for the hell of it.
  In the book at one point he even takes out his drivers license and
  shows it to Marla to prove that he's not Tyler Durden, but Marla was
  introduced to him under a dozen different names in the support groups.
  So when he finally comes to save her as Tyler, that's who she knows
  him as. All the people who have met him have met him as Tyler, so
  that's who they know him as. But his name is reallyΓÇª. I have no idea.


According to IMDB][2], Palahniuk explains that he "named Tyler Durden after the character of Toby Tyler in Toby Tyler, or Ten Weeks with a Circus, and a man called Durden with whom Palahniuk worked, who was fired for sexual harassment. Marla Singer was named after a young girl called Marla who used to beat up Palahniuk's sister in school." So the name has symbolic meaning to the author, not the character.
AnswerKenntnis:
As a member of Project Mayhem, the narrator has no name. Tyler can have a name, because he is not the true identity, and therefore not a real person-- and therefore not a member of project mayhem.
AnswerKenntnis:
Edward Norton's character's name is Tyler Durden. He asks his girlfriend Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) what his name is. She replies, "Tyler Durden." The next time The Narrator interacts with Tyler, Tyler says to him, "I told you not to talk to her about me."

So Tyler seems to know about it only after The Narrator knows.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why do British sitcoms have so many fewer episodes than American ones?
qn_description:
Through Netflix & Amazon streaming, I have recently "discovered" a bunch of really good British sitcoms that I never knew existed.

Although I think some of these comedies are as good or better than anything on U.S. television, my only complaint is that there aren't enough of them. I get hooked on them and then watch all the episodes available in a day or two, while it would take weeks to watch all the episodes of a typical successful American sitcom.

For example:


the British version of The Office only had 14 total episodes.  The U.S. version of The Office currently has almost 200.
The show Coupling lasted for only 4 seasons and 28 episodes, while Friends ran for 10 seasons and over 200 episodes. (I know this isn't the same show, but thought they were comparable)
The IT Crowd, which I also found hilarious, sadly ran for only 24 episodes.


Now one of the benefits of these shows producing fewer episodes is that the writers don't seem to run out of ideas and there are no "Jump the Shark" plotlines. But surely there are more good stories to be told about these characters, aren't there?

Can someone from across the pond explain why these really good and (I'm assuming) very successful shows have so few episodes & seasons?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
From BBC America - Five Bizarre Things About British Television:


  
  The Six Episode Season
  Most British drama or comedy shows have a very short season. The classic amount for comedies is just six episodes per series ΓÇô The Office being a prime example ΓÇô and thereΓÇÖs one very good reason for this. 
  
  American comedy is a producerΓÇÖs medium, in which an idea is worked up, characters developed and early scripts written, and then the show is handed over to a larger group of writers to flesh out into actual scripts. 
  
  British comedy is a writerΓÇÖs medium. The scripts are almost always written and developed by one or two people, then taken to production. Graham Linehan, the writer of Father Ted and The IT Crowd, even directs his own scripts, which is a LOT of work. 
  


From TIME Magazine - What the U.S. Can Learn from British TV:


  There are underlying economic reasons for the two different models. 
  
  The goal of almost any American commercial series is to air at least 100 episodes, because thatΓÇÖs when it can be sold into syndication and aired as reruns on other stations or networks. ThatΓÇÖs where the real money is. 
  
  But the BBC is publicly financed, so not every show has to earn its investment back with a multiseason run.


From TV Tropes - British Brevity:


  British shows usually have a fairly small creative team. 
  
  It's not uncommon for one person to single-handedly write every episode of a show, as Steven Moffat did with Coupling, or David Renwick with Jonathan Creek. 
  
  There's more pressure to succeed, and less of a chance to make a lasting impression or develop long plot arcs. Ruin two episodes and that's a third of a season down the tubes. Some American shows that start off weak can grow their beard when the show would have long been over in the UK.
  
  On the other hand, British shows tend to have the entire series filmed before broadcast, so shows are rarely canceled mid-season, or affected by events like a writers' strike.




Another thing to keep in mind is that the US has 114 million TV households, whereas the UK has 26 million. Less viewers means there is less money to be made. And less money means less episodes.
AnswerKenntnis:
To expand on Donald's answer, larger budgets in the US mean many more writers. American sitcoms are typically written in large teams (20+ writers), with one writer penning an episode that includes contributions from all on the team. (Incidentally The Simpsons' writers have stated on DVD commentaries that the credited writer only ends up with about 30% of the lines in the final episode.)

In Britain however, that set-up simply does not exist. Sitcoms are typically written by just one or two writers in isolation, and they often direct too. For example, The Office was written and directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant while The IT Crowd was written solely by Graham Linehan (a prolific comedy writer).

Subjectively, us Brits like to think of it as quality over quantity ;)
AnswerKenntnis:
The most likely explanation is simple economics. Since the US population is approximately five times that of Great Britain, the television viewership is significantly larger, allowing for larger budgets per episode and more total episodes.
AnswerKenntnis:
A lot of this depends on the TV schedule, and if the season was filmed before it ran on TV. Some networks will purchase a season in it's completed form. This covers the costs of production and film crew. It's much more expensive to hire a crew for 12 weeks, then for 12 days. So you could film 12 episodes quickly and air them on TV over a weekly schedule to recover costs.

Some shows like Friends become so popular the network can afford a full-time production crew. So they switch from pre-filming seasons to producing shows weekly. Keeping a crew on hand to produce each weekly show. Some shows can have operating costs over $1 million per episode.

Stargate for example ran for 10 years, and resulted in a full-time crew with their own production studio just for filming Stargate. Where as the first season of Terra Nova was all filmed at once, and after it ran it was cancelled.

There are a lot of popular British shows that have full-time schedules, but most of what you were watching were less known or popular. As a result, they were likely pre-film in smaller batches.
AnswerKenntnis:
I think that Oliver_C has the best answer with information to back it up, but I would like to point out that there are many long running British shows too. Are You Being Served, Last of the Summer Wine to name two. The Office wasn't a hit when it first aired. It could be described as "brilliant but cancelled". Coupling aired in the U.S. and was quickly canceled. One really good thing about about a writer's medium show is that the series can have an actual end instead of a sudden cancellation.  If only some U.S. shows could be written like that. Heroes would have been a good series. Firefly would have had a proper ending within the series. But overall most British shows such as No Heroics are written not to become a hit but to be well liked.

Is the Unix operating system featured in Jurassic Park real?
qn_description:
When the film Jurassic Park came out, and I saw that scene where Ariana Richards is sitting in front of the computer and says;


  This is a Unix system.  I know this.  It's the files for the whole park.  It's like a phone book - -it tells you everything.


I've always wondered. Is that silly 3D interface they show on the monitor actually real? Was there a 3D file navigator for Unix back in 1993.
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Yes, it is absoluely a real Unix system, it was a Silicon Graphics workstation (using IRIX, the SGI System V based Unix) running a three dimensional file system browser.

Silicon Graphics were early developers of hardware acceleration for 3D graphics, so it makes complete sense that even in 1993 they had Unix workstations capable of a 3D file system viewer.

The fact that the SGI logo is visible on the monitor, makes me wonder whether this was an example of product placement.

QuestionKenntnis:
What is the main theme of The Dark Knight?
qn_description:
According to Wikipedia, the main theme of The Dark Knight is escalation, such that each event lead to an escalation that results from the choices Batman and James Gordon make. A separate source said that if one were to start from the beginning the movie can be seen as sequence of small games with the first being the robbery scene.

The robbery scene being compared to that of the Pirate Game. 

Is it possible that the primary theme is actually Game Theory? Since the actual escalation didn't occur until the end with the prisoner's dilemma and Harvey kidnapping Gordon's family? What is the main theme of The Dark Knight?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
The Dark Knight, in my view, is an epic description of the Joker's character. There is no other theme to the movie. Just as 'Batman Begins' was centered mainly around the characterization of the Batman. I observed a similarity and a difference between the Joker and the other mob bosses/bad guys.

The similarity is that, both the bad guys and Joker have anti-social ideas. The difference lies in what level of sophistication the players employ. The other guys want to kill Batman and prey on the fearful. Joker is different. He just wants to kill everyone else. He also wants to prove that everyone is inherently un-altruistic / sadistic. That is why he conducts the experiment on the ferry with the prisoners and the convicts. This is classic prisoners' dilemma.

He also succeeds in employing Harvey Dent, the supposed hope of Gotham City, the only DA brave enough to prosecute Gotham's criminals, and turn him against Gotham. These are a battery of experiments that he performs - just for the thrill of finding out what happens.
AnswerKenntnis:
During the climax of the movie, there is a dialogue - "Sometimes truth is not good enough. Sometimes people deserve more. They deserve to have their faith rewarded". While these dialogues are presented, we see two scenes. 


Alfred burning the letter that Rachel gave to Bruce. Here, Bruce believes that Rachel was going to wait for him but that's not the truth and if revealed, it can break Bruce. So, Alfred hides the truth.
Batman asks Gordon to say that Batman killed Harvey because they can not let Joker win. So the truth is that Joker was successful in shaking up Gotham. He indeed took the best man and turned him bad. But Batman & Gordon hide this truth so that the people of Gotham don't lose their faith.


This, according to me, is the main theme of the movie.
AnswerKenntnis:
In addition to the already existing good answers, another theme of the movie, with a strong connection to current political and social problems, is of course terrorism.

Especially how to deal with people (or one man in this case) who are not driven by "ordinary" criminal motives (like money) and don't react to the threats of "ordinary" punishment (like imprisonment or death), how easy it is for them to push an organized society (that is just not prepared for such an irrational person) into chaos and, most important, how far the society's executive organs (in this case the Batman) would go (or what he needs to become himself) to stop such a person.

This culminates in Batman building the perfect surveillance state (with those unrealistic cell-phone radars). Although he is smart or honest enough to destroy this machine once he's found the Joker, he has obviously crossed a line there.

To conclude, I think it is hard to find one single theme to describe the movie, as it contains many interresting themes. And I would say Nolan himself (he wrote it, didn't he?) didn't have one single theme in mind to center the story around.
AnswerKenntnis:
This is an old thread and I assume you've already turned in your paper, but it's an interesting question so I wanted to share an answer.

Like many good movies, The Dark Knight has several themes, but to me the primary theme of the movie is duty. The reason why I say this is because the primary conflicts of the film are centered around that theme:


Joker - he explained to Harvey that he was a dog chasing cars, that he didn't really have much of a plan but that he just wanted to induce a little carnage. He enjoyed his duty, but the thing that motivated him - that got him to keep going after Batman - was that he felt a duty to disrupt, to shake up, to change, to show people what they were really made of.
Batman - duty incarnate. He is scarred, physically and mentally and does not want to keep doing this job but the city needs him. He could have, and wanted to, kill the Joker, but chose not to because he duty is to uphold the law, not become the law. And after Harvey's death, he takes responsibility. Commissioner Gordon's speech over the closing credits sums up Batman about as perfectly as anything I've ever seen written about him does.
Harvey Dent - Harvey was pulled into politics by Bruce Wayne, who told him it was his duty to protect the people of Gotham City. And when he lost Maggie Gyllenhall's character, he went insane but at the core of that insanity was still duty -- to represent the arbitratiness of the world.
Lucius - Lucius set up the cell phone monitors for Bruce Wayne not because he wanted to, but because he felt a duty to Bruce to help him stop the Joker.
Inspector Gordon - hid the details of his death from his wife to serve the greater duty of catching the Joker.
Bank robbers - each did their assigned task, progressively executing each other, even though at some point no one asked (until it was dramatically appropriate) why if they had orders to kill another robber, it stood to reason that another robber had orders to kill them.
Boat bombs - another examination of duty and responsibility. The people on the boats had the duty to save themselves, but Tiny Lister transcended that to show that even duty can have too high of a cost, and that's why he threw the detonator out of the window.


In that sense, 6 and 7 are evolution points of the script in that 6 is about what happens when someone blindly does their duty and 7 is about when someone refuses to do a duty to serve a higher purpose. IMHO, anyway.

And now I have done my duty, which was to provide an answer to this question, so I am finis.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why all the fancy technology in most movies?
qn_description:
In most of the movies and TV-series I have watched, whenever there is some kind of "technology" involved (say, like a tracking device or hacking something important), there is a lot of unnecessary, impractical key-pressing and fancy colors and sounds (a lot of 1's and 0's going on the screen and a lot of "beep"s).

For example, take the TV-series Primeval. Their device for tracking anomalies have a lot of the things said above.

Why do movies and TV-series employ this kind of false-looking tech? It would have been much easier to use a real OS (like MacOS for normal things and Linux for hacking-kind-of things), maybe with a custom-made software suited to the task. It would have been more realistic.

So is there any specific reason for this?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Well, I think there is perfect reason for it: audience appeal. Of course those things are totally unrealistic and over the top, but show a simple black-and-white console to the audience or a basic database application and they will just find it boring to look at or think there is not much to it.

Of course it bothers the hell out of those who know better, but the average guy that uses his computer for YouTube, Facebook and maybe Office is just more pleased with colorful displays and stunning graphics in a simple database query and is more likely to accept that there is something interesting going on. It's about conveying the information inherent in those abstract and hard to grasp processes in an interesting and entertaining way, thus sacrificing some realism for the sake of story-telling.

(And of course all hackers fluently communicate in 0s and 1s, which makes them so awesome. ;-))
AnswerKenntnis:
I think one reason is that it explicitly divorces the tech in the show from real world tech.  This allows writers more freedom because there isn't going to be some expert somewhere saying "That isn't how you use regular expressions!"

If the tech is "fancy" then only those in the show are the experts.
AnswerKenntnis:
Mainly, because it follows the basic principle of "do it like somebody else, but maybe flashier."  It is a simple audio/visual cue that viewers are used to.

It's really no different than hearing a "slap" sound when somebody gets punched (instead of a thud), or somebody flying backwards when they get shot, or zooming in on a license plate from a hijacked satellite feed with a half-dozen key strokes (and no mouse).

Reality is boring.
AnswerKenntnis:
Sorry I'm so late to the party on this one, but I thought I'd share some of the research I've found for a academic project, so here's my contribution.

KennyPeanuts and Wonko the Sane both give interesting examples, and Napoleon Wilson cuts to the heart of it, but all three answers hint towards but do not explicitly discuss the wider trend they are discussing.

Perhaps one of the most prevalent visual trends in modern cinema (and seems to be found across genre, not neccesarily limited to Sci-Fi) is a tendency towards...

TECHNO-FETISHISM.

Tecnho-Fetishism is a piece of wide terminology identifying behavior/preference that privileges the use/appearance of advanced technology, traditionally associated with the Sci-Fi/fantasy genre but more recently expanding across all areas of artistic/commercial enterprise.



Emergence/History

Techno-fetishism is inherently attached to the Computer-Age, but has only truly blossomed within the Modern (current) Information Age.

The concept of techno-fetishism is alleged to have been borne out of commerce, which is a problematic claim as it eliminates any notion of an organic cultural preference, in favor of a marketing model.

That being said, Tech Companies such as Apple and Samsung have seemingly identified this consumer trend, and appear to be exploiting it for commercial gain. This is probably due to more advanced technology being widely available within the domestic market, influencing notions of commodity.

Techno-fetishism is also closely linked to the legacy of Futurism, and the two terms can often be found being used interchangeably. This is fine, but Futurism is more of an aesthetic movement and Techno-Fetishism is considered a behavioral model.

Japan is obviously a huge proponent of the movement, both culturally and artistically. The Japanese term Otaku is a derisive description of a Tecnho-fetishist, although its negative connotations seem to have been lost in translation in the process of western circulation. There is a lot to be researched here, as Mecha-Anime is surely one of the most functionary conduits of the 'genre'.



In Movies

Modern 'Mainstream' Cinema, in a typical reflection of the modernity, seems to be adopting techno-fetishism reflexively. 

It's perhaps still very early days, and hasn't seemed to have been fully explored/identified academically (hence my research), but technological interface seems to be a staple of many movies, sometimes the theme itself.

The Spike Jonze movie Her is a very interesting example, and perhaps ahead of its time (even though it is yet to be released!). Another good exploration of the way we interface with technology is The Entire History of You, a very good episode of Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror. The two are thematically similar, but seem to directly address modern cultures addiction to technology in a very mature way.

As Wonka the Sane skirted around, advanced technology is often 'air-dropped' into movies, and can often be jarring. 

I personally think the high-watermark of this trend is Quantum of Solace, where the 'Sci-Fi table' seems to be a totally unnecessary demonstration of tech-for-the-sake-of-tech.

 

The MCU is a franchise that has readily adopted Techno-fetishism, and Iron Man remains the most exploratory of these trends. The Studio should be congratulated as a powerful example of how cultural preferences can be seamlessly stitched into pre-existing canon's, through camouflage and concealment.

It could be said that the different characters of of the MCU are on divergent paths that manipulate modern cultural trends:


Iron Man-Techno-fetishism Tony Stark, is a GatesJobsian avatar of technology and commercial responsibility, being an representation of futurist altruism. 
Thor-Mysticism The Asgardian world is a beautifully rendered demonstration of Historical/Fantasy mysticism, and openly signals and engages fans of such a genre.  
Captain America-Nostalgia Whilst outwardly imperialistic, Captain America is actually a felicitous exploration of America's Modern Cultural identity by exploring old fashioned ideals of heroism. The First Avenger also capitalized in the 1930s/40s retro-styling that has emerged within wider fashion, a preference elicited by Vintage clothing.   


I realize that the question you have asked is not about MCU, but I hoped to demonstrate how Iron Man is an example of a commercial entity recognizing and exploiting the very trend you have yourself identified, and demonstrating how it is only part of a wider marketing strategy.



In summary

The reason why there is so much 'Fancy Technology' in movies is because there is an active market for it, and movies will always respond to market forces favorably. 
Mainstream Movies will exploit the visual language of technology, and more artistic features will criticize and explore our interaction with it.
This is nothing especially new, but it is accelerating in pace.
AnswerKenntnis:
an interesting case study here is use of computers and computer-like systems in movies. here are several well researched articles on Wired site on this topic which shed some light on the question.


The Most Wonderfully Ridiculous Movie Computers of All Time
Return of the WorldΓÇÖs Most Wonderfully Ridiculous Movie Computers
The Five Most Powerful Movie Computers


the 3rd article emphasizes the "make the gadgets look visually cool" aspect


  Computer in movies suffer from one major problem. Real computers are boring. To juice things up, movie makers tend to add spinning, glitzy interfaces, perfect voice recognition and security that can be cracked in seconds.


however the 1st two articles point out an interesting historical aspect:


  For decades, the AN/FSQ-7 -- Q7 for short -- helped define the image of a computer in the popular consciousness. Nevermind that it was just a radar system originally backed by tens of thousands of vacuum tubes. For moviegoers everywhere, this was the sort of thing that automated myriad tasks not only in modern-day America but the distant future.


in other words some of the original flashy computers were real "control" or "monitoring" systems. (but not necessarily computers). they seemed to have high audience appeal and their design inspired later fake props. in other words decades ago, some real control systems actually were very flashy and colorful and these real systems were used in the movies and influenced later props. some of the real systems were reused in many movies.
AnswerKenntnis:
I disagree with the general tenor on this page that technology is fancy in movies because people like fancy technology and get excited to see it. Apart from production design geeks, it doesn't make sense to me that an audience would choose to go see a movie for some fancy interfaces. They aren't a centerpiece like big action sequences or character development, they're typically a means to an end. 

However, in most cases, that end does require technology that is different from realistic modern-day tech. Chances are, if someone is looking at a screen or an interface in a movie or TV show, there is important information being relayed, either about something happening in the character's world or about how the character is solving the problem. "Fancy technology" may be more visually pleasing to look at, but it's also more suited to get the most important plot information across quickly. 


Instant plot communication: Half a season of Doctor Who revolved around this kind of instantly legible technology. The show was able to use a highly stylized pregnancy scan screen to bring up a recurring storyline in seconds. Disregarding how incongruous a Earth operating system would seem on the TARDIS, anything with a similar workaday tech aesthetic wouldn't have handled the storyline as well. 
Character development: Using John Smith's background of the MCU, a perfect example of "fancy technology" performing important character development is The Avengers. Tony Stark's most important character trait is how he thinks. The movies wouldn't be engaging without all of the scenes where he is doing nothing but inventing or figuring out a problem on his own. As for why technology is important to making that interesting, compare the scenes of him inventing the suit for the first time with later scenes back in America with Jarvis. Technology makes being alone interesting and allows the audience into his thought process, without forcing Pepper to constantly be his exposition buddy. It allows a whole new character and humor dynamic to emerge. 
Illustrating relationships: Granted, I can't think of a good example of this outside of The Avengers but their use of technology is my favorite. Twice in the movie, technology helps hit emotional points in cleaner, quicker and more effective ways than other methods. First is when Stark and Banner are first interacting trying to chase down the cube (I think, I'm fuzzy on their objective). Stark and Banner are two geniuses, and showing how they work together, and how Stark continues to push Banner as they work is an essential part of their storyline and best told through tech. That moment when Stark minimizes all of the windows on the transparent glass display is perfect. In the same movie, Stark attempting to call Pepper one last time before his sacrifice, with that portrait of her inside his helmet, is more affecting than an actual conversation would have been because it allows the audience member to fill in the emotional dots. 
Defining worlds: Sorry, I keep coming up with examples from the Marvel universe. Their use of tech is on point. It is important for the MCU that the Asgardians aren't actually magic or gods, they're just highly advanced aliens. This is made clear in Thor: Dark World when Jane Foster is entranced by the interface of the medical technology used to help her. When they tell her it's a "soul forge", she figures out the underlying science and describes it in terms of human technology. It's a great moment for showing what kind of a thinker and person she is, and it shows that the Asgardians are just highly advanced, not magical. 


All of these more pointed, plot-oriented uses of technology would be impossible or highly difficult. Iron Man doesn't have Android installed on his suits not because people would get bored and spend less money on his movies, but because Android wouldn't tell his story as well. Granted, these are some of the best uses of technology I could think of, I know there is a lot of warrantless techno-fetishism out there.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why do Disney parents usually die?
qn_description:
It's well known that many animated Disney movie parents (at least one of a set) die, were never in the picture, or started the movie already dead. 

Is this just a financial thing (like in Toy Story), or does Disney have any other reason for this?

Some examples:


Toy Story - Dad doesn't exist
The Lion King - dad dies
Cinderella - mom is dead, dad dies
Aladdin - orphan
Lilo and Stitch - orphans
The Jungle Book - orphan
The Little Mermaid - mom dies 
Beauty and the Beast - motherless
Bambi - mom dies
Finding Nemo - mom dies
Frozen - parents die
Sleeping Beauty - mom is dead, evil step-mom dies
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
I am answering subjectively here, but I think it really comes down to evoking even more sympathy for the main characters. Not only do they often have to battle difficult circumstances (i.e. being an outcast or something similar), but they also have to deal with being alone in the world. All of this creates genuine sympathy for the protagonists.

This Daily Mail article also addressed the issue. Although they agreed with my first point, they also had this fascinating theory:


  Might the death of Walt Disney's mother  -  and the lifelong guilt
  this left her son with  -  be the catalyst for the death of parents in
  Disney?  
  
  In 1938 and riding high with the proceeds from his first big
  screen movie Sleeping Beauty, Walt bought his mother, Flora, and his
  father, Elias, a house in LA as a golden wedding anniversary present. 
  
  Within days of moving in, Flora complained about the stultifying
  temperatures coming from the central heating boiler and her doting son
  arranged for a swift replacement.  
  
  Days later, Flora died from
  asphyxiation caused by the new, poorly-installed, boiler.  
  
  Might Walt
  Disney's misplaced guilt over his mother's death have led him to
  airbrush parents  -  mothers in particular  -  out of his works?  
  
  And
  has that motivation, after his death in 1966, become a Disney
  blueprint?  
  
  Certainly, it would explain the types of folk stories and
  fairytales that Disney has acquired for adaptation, even when there
  are numerous other traditional tales that feature a mother and father.


Finally, it's also worth noting that not all movies have dead parents. This list shows the following Disney films as having both parents alive at the end of the film:


Lady and the Tramp   
Sleeping Beauty    
One Hundred and One Dalmatians   
Mulan   
The Incredibles   
Peter Pan    
Brave    
Lion King 2    
Tangled (although parent-like villain dies)
Hercules


Edit:

I whipped this answer up fairly quickly and really should have expanded on a few points. As many comments under the post have indicated, this "style" is a common trope. As TV Tropes express (rather tongue-in-cheek):


  Parents Are Useless. They leave you and abuse you. Good Parents are
  hard to come by. It appears that the only decent parents are the dead
  ones. 
  
  These are the parents that leave the characters behind, not by
  choice, early on in the story, sometimes even before the story begins.
  The characters are now all alone with no family. They may find a
  Parental Substitute, but they may not always be the best guardians.
  
  These often heroic characters will always have fond memories of their
  parents. That's because these parents did everything right while they
  were alive. They spent time with their children and taught them
  invaluable life lessons that they continue to keep even to this day.
  Even though the parents are gone now, the actions of the parents still
  affect the character and keep him going.


Finally, it does make logical sense (from an animation point of view) for parents to die as it would most definitely cut down on production costs - although the life lessons learned from their deaths are obviously the main focus.
AnswerKenntnis:
Its not just the animated movies; Disney corporation also made a lot of live action films that have this pattern:


A family is damaged.
A child has an adventure as a result. During the adventure the child becomes more like an adult, taking responsibility for themselves and others, and ultimately becomes a hero.
The family is restored, or a new family is created, as a result of the child's heroism.


Why does the family have to be damaged? Because a functioning family has the parents responsibly solving the serious problems on behalf of the child. If the family unit is functioning then there is no adventure where the child has to solve a problem on their own, and hence no story. 

It's the same reason why Gandalf disappears halfway through The Hobbit: the fifty-years-old-but-effectively-still-a-child Bilbo has to become the adult and then the hero, by solving problems on his own. And the same reason why Beru and Owen are killed early and Kenobi disappears halfway through Star Wars: the raised-by-his-aunt-and-uncle child Luke has to become an adult and then the hero, by solving problems on his own. The protective parental figures have to be removed for the story to be about the growth of a child into an adult and then a hero.

"Finding Nemo" uses this trope particularly effectively as both Nemo and Marlin are essentially children who grow up during their adventure.
AnswerKenntnis:
It's already been pointed out that not all Disney films include the death of a parent, but there are indeed a few that does and the reason for that, I believe, is because of the targeted audience. Children.  

For most children, parents are thought of as gods. Not in the sense that they are always respected and obeyed (unfortunately), but in the sense that they are presumed to live forever (at least to see their children grow up and start a family) and they also seem to be able to do pretty much anything. There are of course exceptions, not all children adore their parents, but as with everything that is commercial you shoot for the widest possible audience. To most of the kids that do, however, the greatest task ever is to live up to be as great, or greater than, your parent(s) and the biggest fear is to lose one or both of them. Of course, if you'd ask them they would probably answer "jump to the moon" and "that the boogie-man in the closet eats them." But, because of the importance of parents in the lives of their children, these situations make for great movie themes. To overcome the death of a parent and/or to try and become as great as your mom or dad.

Answer to be elaborated even further...
AnswerKenntnis:
When writing for children, it is quite common (regardless of authorship or medium) to minimize the role of parents in the story.  Many non-Disney or pre-Disney children's stories find a good way of reducing or removing the role of parents.

Here are some prominent examples from non-Disney stories:


The Chronicles of Naria - despite having children from many different families as heroes, the parents are barely mentioned and are far removed from the action.
Harry Potter - Harry is an orphan and all of the heroes are removed from their parents for the vast bulk of the story.
Winnie the Pooh - Christopher Robin's parents are barely heard of in the original AA Milne stories (which I have read but have sadly lost).


The reason for this is rather simple.  Children are used to their parents saving the day, providing protection and nurturing them.  A narrative is about characters facing challenges that are on the edge of their capabilities.  When a parent is present, able and willing to help, the child is implicitly safe and the story is far less compelling.

Even in stories where the parents do play a prominent part, they are portrayed as detached or disbelieving of the troubles of the child or are a form of antagonist themselves.

The same principle applies to teen fiction.  Much teen fiction relies on settings where the parents are either removed or ignored.

So rather than being a "Disney thing", this is actually a "children's fiction thing".
AnswerKenntnis:
Here is an article based on a Malcolm Gladwell argument that suggests that the loss of a parent in real life makes one more likely to have either great success or great failure. I think there could be a truth here that the Disney movies are consciously or unconsciously tapping into. The article and its comments may offer some good insights: Successful Children Who Lost A Parent ΓÇö Why Are There So Many Of Them?


  
  67 percent of British prime ministers from the start of the 19th century to the start of World War II lost a parent before the age of
  16.
  Twelve presidents ΓÇö George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson, Rutherford Hayes, James
  Garfield, Grover Cleveland, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton
  and Barack Obama ΓÇö lost their fathers while they were young.
  Prisoners are two to three times more likely to have lost a parent in childhood than the population as a whole.
AnswerKenntnis:
oedipus complex... ties into the theory the child must grow to defeat the same sex parent and take the strength of the other... the main characters cannot grow into the powerful images they have with both parents involved. Also, if both parents are alive in the movies, they would be able to balance roles of authority vs companion... without that the child feels angered/betrayed and must seek answers their own way.
QuestionKenntnis:
Was the original "Pink Panther" movie intended to be a comedy?
qn_description:
I'm a big fan of the Pink Panther movies (the ones with Peter Sellers, not new ones with Steve Martin).  But after watching The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, I'm left with the impression that the original The Pink Panther was intended to be a serious film, but Peter Sellers essentially tried to sabotage the production out of spite, turning it into a comedy, and subsequently turning it into the classic hit it became.  The sequels all have much more of a comedy feel, which would be consistent with this sequence of events.

But how accurate was the portrayal of these events in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers?  Can I read more about the dynamics that took place during the creation of the original movie and the sequel?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
From NNDB:


  Edwards' most famous work, The Pink Panther, was released in 1963, with Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The part had originally been cast with Peter Ustinov, but that actor reneged at the last minute, and Sellers stepped in, with his suggestion that the character be "bumbling", which, of course, changed not just the character, but the nature of film comedy.


And from a Review by Clarenc Beaks:


  The Pink Panther (1963) began life as a star-studded caper comedy intended to be anchored by David Niven as the debonair jewel thief Sir Charles Lytton, aka "The Phantom," a man audacious enough to carry on an affair with the wife of his tireless, if thoroughly inept, pursuer, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. And had Peter Ustinov, originally cast as Clouseau (and, coincidentally, batman to the higher-ranking Niven in World War II), not backed out of the production, following Ava Gardner's lead (who had been cast as Clouseau's philandering spouse), it's entirely possible that there would have been no Pink Panther franchise (though a great thespian, Ustinov was hardly anyone's idea of an explosive comedic talent). But when Peter Sellers came on board as the incompetent inspector, the picture was suddenly given a raucously funny performer who easily could run away with the proceedings.


So it seems it was intended to be a comedy from the beginning, but quite a different style of comedy than what it became once Sellers got involved.
AnswerKenntnis:
I do recall the first Pink Panther movie being less slapstick in its approach, a more subtle performance from the cast - but I would find it hard to believe that they set out to make a serious movie and ended up with a comedy.

No matter how big the star, I simply don't believe they would let someone completely revise the genre of a movie like that.  Peter Sellers was almost exclusively known as a comedic actor, in both Radio and Movies, it was very much the exception when he played serious parts.  His write up on IMDB starts "Often credited as the greatest comedian of all time".

I have no evidence, but I just don't find it credible.
AnswerKenntnis:
Yes, I saw documentaries with Blake Edwards and he knows lot about comedy and visual gags. I'm sure he knew he was doing a comedy.

The spanish documentary "Y usted ... ┬┐de que se r├¡e?" contains an interview with Blake Edwards about comedy.
AnswerKenntnis:
In deciding whether the film was originally planned as a comedy you might look, for instance at the names of the Director, the screenwriter, and the cast.

How many films did Peter Sellers make which were not comedies, for instance? His entire reputation was in comedy, from the time of his earliest beginnings in radio with 'The Goon Show'.

Blake Edwards was not known for making Shakespearean drama, nor even for making contemporary drama. He was not Irwin Allen, who directed 'Towering Inferno' and 'The Poseidon Adventure'. Nor was he Cecil B DeMille.

It is a mistake to suppose that the lead actor, Sellers, can re-write the screenplay. Only the director of the film can do that; and if the actors wish to make changes, this cannot be done without the agreement and support of the director. 

Sellers had the ability to make a humorous screenplay funnier in performance than it might appear on the written page; but unless the director was making a comedy, Sellers had no chance of getting laughs, if that was not Edwards' intention.

Then again, why hire Sellers at all, unless you were making a comedy?
QuestionKenntnis:
Why does Bane protect the girl?
qn_description:
In the final twist of the movie, it is revealed that Talia is actually the one to have climbed out due to Bane helping her get up the hole.

However, Bane's pure motivation during the events of the movie lead the audience to believe that his only motive is a more physical and structured one of the Joker of taking over Gotham.

It is never lead on that Bane is sympathetic to anyone during the movie, so why would he protect a young Talia and endure a great injury, just to save her?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
I felt that while we assumed Bane was the child that escaped, it was because we knew his backstory included him being incarcerated as a child. I think that this is still the case and that the mirroring of his own circumstances was enough to want to protect Talia and help her be free. He was a man tortured by hope amongst criminals in the pit, he ended up caring only for Talia's happiness. Also, Talia's mother may have spoke to him about Ra's Al Ghul and promised to save him if he helps the child escape.
AnswerKenntnis:
Bane protected Talia in the Pit because he could empathize the pain that he'd been going through since he was a child with her. He, like Talia, was "born in the dark, molded by it" and "didn't see the light until he was already a man". He wanted to preserve the innocence that he lost during his childhood by protecting Talia. Bane is like a second father to her.
AnswerKenntnis:
The motivation for the League of Shadows' acts of seemingly-random destruction was stated in Batman Begins as a kind of purification of society once it had become too corrupt.  Bruce Wayne's point of difference with the League was not about ends, but means.  The members of the League of Shadows see themselves as good people willing to do what it takes to purify humanity.

There is therefore no contradiction in Bane being compassionate and self-sacrificing and joining the League.  If he was just out for himself, the League would have probably had no interest in him.

The League tried to harness Bruce's rage, but succeeded in twisting Bane's compassion.
AnswerKenntnis:
It's stated in the move that the "protector" saves the child due to a feeling that the innocence of the child needs to be preserved. In all likelyhood, Bane could sympathize with Talia, having himself grown up in prison.
AnswerKenntnis:
I think initially Bane's motivations aren't about evil. He saw the similarity between him and Talia growing up in the pit so he helped her to escape.

After helping Talia and being attacked by the prisoners, his motives changed as he was in constant pain. This pain lead him down the path of evil and eventually onto becoming "Gotham's Reckoning".
AnswerKenntnis:
I figured that Miranda was with Bane but was dissapointed that he ended up being just a fool in love. But when you think about it it does make sense . Bane was a purely rational and sane mercenary, so once it was established his main motive was not money then it had to be something else, LOS? but in reality he was a mercenary so doubt he shared their agenda n also they kicked him out before, so if its not money or ideology then it can only be love.
AnswerKenntnis:
This is actually explained in the prisoner's story, as he tells it to Bruce:


  The legend is that there was a mercenary who worked for the local
  warlord. He fell in love with warlord's daughter. They were married in
  secret.
  
  When the warlord found out, the mercenary was condemned to this pit.
  But then he exiled him instead. The mercenary understood that was the
  daughter who had secured his release.
  
  But what he could not know was the true price of his freedom. She took
  his place in the pit. And she was with a child. The mercenary's child.
  
  Innocence cannot flower underground. It was to be stamped out.
  
  One day, the doctor forgot the lock the cell. But the child had a friend. A protector who showed the other that this innocence was their redemption, it was to be priced.
  
  The mother was not so lucky.
  
  This is Bane's prison now. He wouldn't want the story told.


Saving this child was the one good (actually, the only significant) thing that Bane could do in his life. He had no prospect of ever leaving the Pit or doing anything remotely significant.

The accepted answer mentions that Talia's mother may have told him about Ra's Al Ghul and that he might have expected to be rescued as a reward. I think this is deeply wrong and maybe even offensive to his motives. A little girl, who has never even seen the outside of the Pit, who had no resources whatsoever, whose father didn't even know that she existed,... her mere survival would be a hard gamble. Also, his own survival of the riot is a minor miracle in itself, and he must have been aware that he is not likely to survive helping Talia. So, expecting any kind of reward is wrong and I strongly believe that his action was completely pure and exclusively focused on the salvation of that one child.

At the end of the movie, when Talia says her goodbyes to Bane, he cries, as he knows it's the last he sees of her, and that both of them are to be dead soon. Obviously, he has huge empathy for her... and only for her.

PShin wrote that "Bane is like a second father to her". This is close, but I think still incorrect. Bane is the father to her (not biological, but in emotional, protective, and every other way) and he sees her as his true daughter. I assume he took her under his protection "as his redemption", and grew very fond of her through the years he cared for her in the Pit.

After all, it is not hard to see that an innocent child was his only (metaphorical) light in the long years he spent there. Hence, his contempt for all but her, and huge devotion to her (and only her). I also think that her feelings are quite reciprocal, and for the quite similar reasons.
AnswerKenntnis:
Maybe because Bane is not evil by nature, The Pit made him ruthless. By birth Bane may be like Bruce, good and kind. Thats why when all the prisoners attacked the young innocent Talia without mercy, Bane is the only one, among the evil prisoners, showed compassion and protected. he is willing to risk himself for the safety of the girl. I also doubt that thats the reason why Ras excomunicate Bane, because he shows compassion to people , the same morality Bruce showed in batman begins that made Ras angry( The scene where Bruce refused to kill a theif ras captured). Maybe Bane is similiar. After all banes attack to Gotham was only a loyalty or to settle a dept he owed to both Talia and Ra`s who helped him from the horrible Pit
QuestionKenntnis:
How far back do I need to watch Doctor Who for it to still make sense?
qn_description:
Doctor Who is a pretty old series going back to 1963.

I have not watched any of it, but it looks very promising. The age of this series is slightly scary and I am thinking about watching later series only.

How far back do I need to watch for the continuity to make sense.  Can I drop all the episodes before the 2005 reboot with Christopher Ecclestone and it still make sense to me?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
There are some great answers here already, but as a huge Whovian I wanted to add a little more information.

As a complete beginner to the series definitely start with the 2005 Doctor Who series. The series will make perfect sense and there will be nothing revealed that will leave you confused (or at least nothing that won't be cleared up later in the series!). 

There are old enemies/allies from the original series that will appear and you'll not realise it - but that won't affect your viewing experience in the least.

Now, if you watch the Series, like it and decide to consider watching the Original Series, consider the following:

Doctor Who kicked off all the way back in 1963. This is significant for a few reasons. The original series was in black and white. Now, I'm a child of the nineties and as much as I'm ashamed to admit it, a lack of colour really does affect a movie for me. I'm so unused to things being black and white that I find it much deeper to embrace older movies/shows. Of course that's not universal and I've enjoyed some fantastic old films and tv shows - but without question they require far more concentration on my part to really get into. If you're anything like me and you think that a lack of colour (at least for the first few series) would bother you, it's worth bearing this point in mind.

Unlike the original Star Trek, which was in colour and has since been touched up/remastered, the original Doctor Who episodes with William Hartnell do show their age. They're certainly watchable and enjoyable, but you'll need to concentrate and accept some very dark/grainy footage at times.

You'll also need to accept that as times changed, so did the character of the Doctor. Nowadays, we want a fun, energetic, brilliant, slightly sexy Doctor, which is where the likes of David Tennant (10th) and Matt Smith (11th) came from. Back then, the idea of the Doctor was that he would be a very intelligent, slightly dotty man. That's the character William Hartnell plays. An old, clever man, who is slightly mischievous. He by no means always saves the day. In fact, in many situations he's the one who gets them into trouble and his companions (Barbara and Ian, two teachers) are the saviours. 

I'm bringing all this up because if you watch the new series, the character that the Doctor portrays is not how it was in the original series (at least to begin with).

Another issue to consider is that in the very beginning Doctor Who had an educational remit. This meant that for every "futuristic" serial it ran, it had to run a serious "historical" serial which would accurately tell a real life historical event (such as Marco Polo, the burning of Rome by Nero etc). Now this remit only last a few series, but it's another thing that's worth bearing in mind.

Finally, if you do decide to go back to the Original Series, there is one more thing you must accept. Due to the wiping policy of the BBC there are a number of episodes of Doctor Who that are missing (mostly Patrick Troughton, the 2nd Doctor's, but also a fair few of Hartnell's (1st Doctor)). 

In other words, if you do start watching William Hartnell right from 1963, within a few years you'll start hitting episodes that you'll either have to listen to the audio from (they were broadcast over radio) or you'll have to skip entirely.

Having said all that, the big positive of going back to the Original Series is that you'll get to soak in all the Doctor Who mythology, hear, see, live and breath the universe presented and be a "true" Whovian! But - it is a long (and expensive) haul. Don't expect to finish anytime soon!

Conclusion 

Unquestionably start with the Modern Series (2005). If you like it and want more and are considering the Original Series, consider the following questions:


Will the black and white/grainy aspect of the stories bother you?
Will the low production costs of original episodes bother you?
Will the different presentation of the Doctor (not as strong/intelligent etc) as modern Doctor bother you?
Will the fact many of the 2nd Doctors serials are missing, meaning you'd have to "skip" them bother you?


If the answer to any of these is yes, then perhaps the Original Series isn't for you.

If the answer to all of these is no, then start watching and enjoying :)
AnswerKenntnis:
You can start with the 2005 series starring Christopher Eccelston if you want the full Doctor Who experience from when it was bought back to TV

However, if you cannot tolerate the poor special effects or cheesier stories, you could jump forward to the 2010 series with Matt Smith as the Doctor.

The Matt Smith episodes have almost nothing in common story-wise with previous episodes, so this can be seen as a safe starting point as well.
AnswerKenntnis:
If you're just starting out, then starting with the reboot makes sense.  They tried to make a fairly clean start and work back into the 'legacy' villians such as the Daleks and the Master.

If you want to backfill from there, there's two DVD sets of the "Doctor Revisited" episodes, where they do a show-and-tell about the prior Doctors leading into one of their episodes: for Hartnell it's "The Aztecs", for Pertwee "Spearhead from Space" (his intro), Tom Baker "Pyramids of Mars", etc.  That should give you a good taste for the style of the prior characters without drowning you in twenty-five years of material.
AnswerKenntnis:
Start with Doctor Who (2005). It's good to understand and works like a reboot (little going back sometimes). It's also a fresh start of the TV series after a long time and also had good success.

Even said the same over scifi.stackexchange.com.
AnswerKenntnis:
Okay I'm with the bulk of the above opinion, starting with the reboot is far and away the best option.

If you want a taster of the original stuff without committing to hundreds of hours of tv there where 2 Peter Cushing movies they aren't cannon but give an okay jumping on point and are in colour with slightly (very slightly) higher production values.

Also the companion show to the 50th anniversary special and Adventure in Time and Space gives a nice grounding to the old series. 

But it's worth remembering for almost 5 decades people have been jumping into it on whatever episode happened to be on and figuring out from there and there's a new Doctor due imminently which is usually a good starting point (The old stuffs not going anywhere go back and catch up when you think you need it/you'll enjoy it there's no shortage of people to give you the reference points online)
AnswerKenntnis:
I'm going to disagree with the majority here.  I think it is worth watching at least some of the classic series early, in order to get an appreciation for where the show has come from.  I'm not going to suggest starting with it, but I think jumping back to it between watching modern episodes could be an enlightening approach (which I wish now I had taken).

I'd also note that it's quite possible to dip in and out of most of the earlier parts of the show without regard to order.  It might make sense, then, to watch the episodes in the order where the ideas they contain become relevant.

My suggestion as to viewing order, therefore, is something like this:


Watch Rose, the first episode of the 2005 series.  This will give you a taste of what the modern series is like.
Watch Spearhead from Space, the first episode of the third Doctor's tenure.  This will make an interesting comparison, because the enemy it deals with is the same enemy that turned up in Rose.
Continue watching the 2005 series up to (but not including) Dalek.  Before watching that, it's time for a history lesson.
Watch original series stories: The Daleks, Dalek Invasion of Earth and Genesis of the Daleks.
Watch the remainder of the 2005 series 1.


By now you should be hooked.  You have an appreciation of both the modern and the original series.  Go back and fill in some of the gaps.  Try interleaving modern and old stories (although be aware that the ends of a lot of the classic stories feed directly into the next story in sequence, particularly starting with Baker's episodes, but they did do this sometimes before).  Don't try to watch everything: many of the older episodes aren't worth watching, particularly the black and white ones: a lot of Hartnell's episodes are slow paced and frankly boring.  Most of Troughton's are missing (but do watch at least the highest few rated of the ones that are available: Tomb of the Cybermen and Invasion are both brilliant, and War Games is really good if you're up for a long story... it took me 5 days to watch, but was well worth it).  After that things start improving, but for me the show really picks up around the time Baker took over, and maybe that's where it's worth watching it all from.  The companion(s) have a lot of influence over the tone, and IMO Sarah Jane Smith was one of the best.  She was companion for Pertwee's last series and the first series-and-a-half of Baker.  Make sure you've watched at least some of these before you get to School Reunion (from the modern series 2).

When you're skipping around between the classic episodes, you'll want a good guide to the episodes with details about ratings, which recurring enemies are involved, and so on.  I use this one.  It's not as detailed as others, but it includes the rankings of each episode in a poll conducted by Doctor Who Magazine a few years ago, which makes it very useful.

Edit

Some more thoughts on specific things to watch and when:


One of the other answers includes a list by Neil Gaiman, which made me think about the episode he wrote in the most recent series, Nightmare in Silver.  This is a Cybermen story, and for the most part the Cybermen in the modern series are not really connected to the original series Cybermen -- unlike most of the other enemies, they completely rebooted the Cybermen, gave them a new origin story, and so on.  So while for the rest of the enemies (particularly the Daleks and the Master) I'd suggest going and watching some of the classic stories about them before seeing the new ones, I don't think this really applies so much to the Cybermen.  Except: Gaiman's story is actually about the classic series Cybermen, not the modern ones -- it is more like the original stories stylistically, and includes reference to a couple of plot points from the original series that haven't previously been incorporated into the modern series (i.e. the future war between humans and cybermen that is in the history of most of the original series episodes featuring them, and a weakness they have that was exploited a few times in the original series but not mentioned previously in the modern episodes).  So, while there's no need to catch up on the cybermen before then, at least prior to watching Nightmare in Silver catch up on the relevant classic episodes: Tomb of the Cybermen, Invasion, Revenge of the Cybermen and Earthshock.
Revenge of the Cybermen is the last part of a continuous sequence of 4th Doctor stories which begins with The Ark in Space and also includes Genesis of the Daleks.  While it isn't critical to watch these in order, I recommend doing so, as they're all good stories.
Earthshock, also mentioned above, is a particularly significant story.  You'll want to have seen some of the stories from the season before it and earlier in the same season before watching it.  The E-space trilogy (which consists of Full Circle, State of Decay and Warrior's Gate) is a reasonable place to start, and the next three episodes that follow it (The Keeper of Traken, Logopolis and Castrovalva) which also form a sequence of stories by themselves are worth watching at this point too. Kinda is divisive.  Some people like it, others hate it.  Read reviews to see if you think it'll be worth watching.
The Master first turns up in the third doctor era, and has a few great stories there (Terror of the Autons and The Daemons are particularly good), but his best stories are in the 4th and 5th Doctors' eras. The Deadly Assassin is one of the best stories in the show (and one of only a handful that don't feature a companion).  The Five Doctors is a classic in its own right. I'll avoid mentioning others, because the show's producers often tried to keep it a surprise that the Master would be in a story, even to the length of using aliases for the actors who played him rather than putting their names directly in the credits.  You can look them up if you feel you're missing anything, but I'll note I've recommended most of them here anyway.
AnswerKenntnis:
While I totaly agree that starting at the beginning of the 2005 reboot is the way to go, I'm going to make an alternative suggestion for if you want to go back a bit further. Start with Jon Pertwee (Third Doctor) either at the start of his tenure, or at the point where the series become colour. You will miss much less ny skipping the first two doctors than the third and fourth. Why?


The show became much more science-fictiony and much less historical around here
The budget went up significantly, as did production values
This is where the Doctor stopped being a grumpy old man and began saving the planet (and later the universe) on a frequent basis
Virtually all the enemies that show up in the reboot make frequent appearances in this period, and you won't lose much of their history by skipping the first two doctors.
You'll meet Brigadier Lethbridge-Stweart and UNIT, which will add some enjoyment to the reboot
Virtually all the episodes are easily available after this point
AnswerKenntnis:
I like a lot of the suggestions, but I wanted to report a suggestion from Neil Gaiman (who wrote several episodes of Doctor Who in addition to several bestselling novels), which I think is quite good:


  IΓÇÖd watch some Doctor Who, if I were you.
  
  Here, IΓÇÖll make you a watching list. Netflix is your friend:
  
  Watch an episode called BLINK.
  
  Watch The Girl in the Fireplace.
  
  Watch Dalek. (Yes, the Doctor looks different. Same man, though.)
  
  Watch The Empty Child two parter.
  
  Watch The DoctorΓÇÖs Wife (I wrote that one, which is why IΓÇÖm putting it on the list.)
  
  Watch City of Death (itΓÇÖs a classic series of shorter episodes from 1978ish, written by Douglas Adams).
  
  Somewhere around there, start watching the New Series 1 with Rose and just come forward normally.


The New Series 1 he is referring to is the same 2005 Modern series that many others have mentioned; its first episode is entitled "Rose."
AnswerKenntnis:
As far as I've seen there are not a whole lot of overarching plotlines in Dr. Who other than "The Doctor is a Time Lord" and "Daleks are bad", and for the most part each episode is a self-contained story with little to do with any other. In the cases that there are callbacks to other stories it's usually concisely explained with something like "don't blink, if you blink you die" or pretty apparent like "Cybermen are also bad".

And like someone else said in here, if you're not confused then you're probably not watching Dr. Who.

Now moisturize me.

In the beginning of Sherlock Holmes (2009), Lord Blackwood attempts to kill a young woman during some sort of dark ritual and is thwarted just in time by Holmes and Watson.

I never saw a definitive explanation, but there are three theories:


Hypnotism (a person with Blackwood's personality and charisma is likely to be a good hypnotist). This is somewhat confirmed by the script (after Holmes stops Blackwood):


  The girl has snapped out of her trance, and is backing away from them as best she can

Somewhat related to the first possibility, please note that the cult members frequently allow the cult leader to exercise nearly total control, up to suicide (see Jim Jones for one of the more dramatic examples, that gave name to the "drinking cool-aid" expression). 

Also, while extremely rare in actuality, sacrifice has happened on the more extreme end of BDSM circles and is an unexpectedly popular thing for many in BDSM as a fantasy.
The "victim" was an actress who was supposed to act like she was about to kill herself, considering that Blackwood pretty much arranged for his own arrest.
AnswerKenntnis:
She was probably a mixture of drugged and hypnotised. 

Observe the power of auto suggestion in the film with the public etc thinking that Blackwood is a demon etc. even the order who are well educated people have convinced themselves they have magic powers.

With the right conditioning, a cocktail of drugs and a touch of Hollywood she could easily have been moved to attempt suicide.
AnswerKenntnis:
Blackwood needed to be arrested and 'killed' so that the public would be aware and afraid of him. Once the public found out about it his reputation would go before him and others, including senior members of the Houses of Parliament, would be more susceptible to blackmail. To be publicly executed he would need to commit a crime to go with his air of magic so what better way than asking members of his cult to commit suicide and making it look like he had control over them?

Basically the girl was an actor and it was all a big publicity stunt.
QuestionKenntnis:
What is the real reason for the Joker's scars?
qn_description:
In The Dark Knight, The Joker told different reasons for the scars on his cheeks. Initially he said that his father gave him the cuts on his cheek as a child after his father performed the same act on his mother, which includes the famous line "Why so serious?".

The Joker also tells Rachel Dawes that his wife had scars due to an accident and that he cut his own cheeks with a razor blade to prove that scars did not matter. 

He starts to tell Batman a third story about how he might have been disfigured. 

Anybody knows what is the real reason?
Was the real reason mentioned in any comics or other books?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
The pure nature of the Joker, especially in the movie sense, is to be completely chaotic wanting "to watch the world burn".  In other words, the Joker is the very definition of the alignment: Chaotic Evil

In the movie, the conflicting stories about his past are there on purpose to continue this nature of just being an agent of chaos.  

Notice how we're never given a flashback of events during his story-telling, something very prominent in the movies in order to remind the audience of events past.  Even Ra's' origins were given flashbacks, although brief and nondescript. 

The only facts to his backgrounds are that he started in Gotham, pitting low-level criminals against each other in elaborate robbery schemes where he comes out on top, with money.  

As a point of reference, the opening scene of The Dark Knight shows his most recent attempt, with a lack of surprise from Gordon on the situation of criminals killing each other during a heist.

But this is only the past year (time between the end of Batman Begins and the beginning of The Dark Knight) and the rest of his timeline is what we see in the movie.

For clarification and emphasis of the answer:

There is no true origin of the Joker in any media.



As far as the comics, the same is true: 

There are a multitude of origins of the Joker told from being a washed up comedian that went nuts, to just being that way from the start.


  Though many have been related, a definitive history of the Joker has never been established in the comics, and his true name has never been confirmed. 
  
  No recounting of the Joker's origin has been definitive, however, as he has been portrayed as lying so often about his former life that he himself is confused as to what actually happened. As he says in The Killing Joke: "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"


source

The one true constant of any depiction of the Joker is that he wants to assert to Batman that all it takes is One bad day to send anyone into the insanity that he lives everyday.  

The most prominent of this is during the short story The Killing Joke where he tortures Gordon almost to this point.

And this is also what makes the Joker such the notorious villain that he is.  No one can ever be certain of anything of him or what he will do.  Whether it be something as simplistic as his background to any of his plans, constantly fooling even the pinnacle of detectives like Batman on multiple occasions.



As a final side note about Joker origin, the story that is most accepted as the "true" origin is The Killing Joke Where he quits his job to be a comedian and goes completely nuts after being knocked into a vat of acid that bleaches his body the traditional Joker colours (all caused by Batman during a heist gone wrong).  

But as there is no confirmation of this origin to the Joker, even this can be taken with a grain of salt.


  The Dark Knight's interpretation of the Joker is based primarily on the character's first two appearances in the Batman comics, as well as Alan Moore's one-shot comic book Batman: The Killing Joke, which was given to Heath Ledger in order to prepare for his role.

Banner's control of Hulk in Avengers
qn_description:
During the climatic battle, Banner says 'That's my secret. I'm always angry', and transforms into the Hulk. Does this imply that Banner learned how to control Hulk? 

If this is the case, why did he transform during the Helicarrier attack?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
My theory is this: 

Banner can already control The Hulk at the beginning of Avengers

This is shown when he is about to show his 'secret' to Black Widow the first time.  They are then interrupted (I forget by what already) before he can show her (presumably, his instant transformation).  It is then shown (in a very epic fashion) that he can turn into The Hulk at will when the giant Chitauri is approaching them stating to Widow "I'm always angry".

However, when Loki was escaping and caused the floor to pop out from underneath him and Widow, he then loses this control due to the sudden nature of the event and therefore doesn't have full control over The Hulk, hence the battle with Thor.
AnswerKenntnis:
My impression was everyone kept assuming the hulk was something he was constantly fighting for control, and whenever he got angry enough to lose his focus he'd run wild, when the reality was Banner doesn't "lose" to the Hulk, he calls him out. Once he transforms he doesn't have a great deal of control over what the Hulk decides to smash, because like he keeps saying, it's 'another guy' taking over at that point, but the choice to change is Banner's. 

It makes sense if you accept Banner the man isn't necessarily a great person to begin with, which I don't think he's ever claimed to be, and can get to the point where he actually wants to unleash the Hulk and let the consequences be damned. This also explains why he'd run off to hide in one of the most densely populated areas of the world, where the collateral damage would be massive if he ever let the Hulk out. It's not to get himself away from stress, it's to put himself in a position where the cost of calling the hulk would be more than he's willing to pay. 

On the airship Loki manipulates them all into wanting to fight each other, which explains why Banner would let the Hulk come out to play, he wasn't losing control over a monster, he was just as eager to throw down as the Cap and Stark were a few seconds earlier. 

Just a thought.
AnswerKenntnis:
He learned to control Hulk, as you could see when he didn't try to smash all of the avengers along the enemy.

On helicarrier he still din't know "his secret", that's why he pummeled them all.

At first he tried to control his anger, on helicarrier it was proven impossible and as a completely wrong solution... After that he realized that he should stop trying to control himself and let his anger take over, which lets him maintain some control. Simply put he was never calm, he was just building up his rage, that's why he said "I'm always angry".
AnswerKenntnis:
When Banner and Stark were in the lab, Stark poked Banner with something.  Then in the same scene he said something along the lines of "I learned to control Iron Man with this thing (points to light on chest) - you can control the Hulk with something too." Banner then says something like: "That won't work for me." Tony then says something like, "Yeah you will, you'll see." Then Banner turns into Hulk on the ship, but whatever Tony did hadn't kicked in yet (at least not fully).  

This is also why Tony knew that Banner would show up at the final battle , saying "Let me know when Banner gets here, okay?" to everyone's surprise, because he knew that Banner should be feeling the effects of whatever Tony did to him.  Then, at the very end, Bruce and Tony ride off together - because now they are close friends who understand each other and share scientific acumen as well.
AnswerKenntnis:
As we saw in the end of the Incredible Hulk, Bruce banner has to have some form of calmness and meditation before he transforms, it's the difference between being calm and under a lot of stress and anger. Also he has to have a clear picture on his enemies and his allies before transforming

On the helicarrier they all fought with each other which caused stress and anger, and to top that Hawkeye blew up one of the engines which caused more stress and anger so the situation took advantage of Bruce, (Hulk controls Banner)

In the city we see him much more calm and at ease before transforming. Captain America tells him that now would be a good time to 'get angry' meaning to transform and Bruce responds by say his secret is that he is always 'angry' just another way of saying he can always transform at will and thus Bruce takes control of Hulk!
AnswerKenntnis:
It seemed to me that Banner's influence over the Hulk depended on how much control he had over the transformation. 

The first time, he transformed because he was in pain, and Hulk was out of his control. The second time, he transformed by choice for a specific reason. 

Helping things along was the fact that during the second transformation, Hulk had a lot of targets to take his rage out on - and no enclosed, confined spaces, either.

Think of it as the difference between a professional football player getting knocked down in a crowded nightclub, versus getting knocked down in the middle of a game. In the second case, he's prepared for it, and has a strategy for venting his anger in the next minute. In the first, he's blindsided and his retalia
QuestionKenntnis:
Pulp Fiction: Explanation of Jule's ending monologue?
qn_description:
I partially understand Jules' ending monologue, although the full meaning doesn't click for me. What is he trying to say in simple terms?


  Jules: Well there's this passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never gave much thought what it meant. I just thought it was some cold-blooded shit to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass. I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. See now I'm thinkin', maybe it means you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9 Milimeter here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. Now I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin', Ringo. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
There are three explanations.


  See now I'm thinkin', maybe it means you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9 Milimeter here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. 


The kid is led astray, Jules is on right path and his gun (and the idea of being killed) is the item preventing him from going off his path.


  Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.


The kid didn't do anything wrong and it Jules' boss and to an extent the system of drugs and money that is evil and selfish. But why would Jules be in the room in first place if the kid didn't do anything wrong. Jules wants that. Jules want to lead everyone to path of righteousness. He doesn't necessarily want to kill him. But it is his job.


  The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men.


This makes the most sense. Jules is the oppressive power of his boss and the kid without the firepower or money is the weak.

In summary, Jules instead of killing him on the spot remarks at the significance of choice within the valley of darkness (the world) to be the shepherd, the righteous or the evil man. And in some cases, the evil man comes out on top.
AnswerKenntnis:
This is has already been answered and accepted, but I feel the need to answer anyway, because I have a very different point of view.  I'll use the same breakdown that phwd uses.


  See now I'm thinkin', maybe it means you're the evil man. And I'm the
  righteous man. And Mr. 9 Milimeter here, he's the shepherd protecting
  my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.


The simplistic and egotistical version.  Ringo is trying to harm him, and can be classified as simply bad.  Jules is free to do whatever he wants.


  Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and
  it's the world that's evil and selfish.  Now, I'd like that.  But that shit ain't the truth.


Assume that Ringo is a good man, and is forced to his path out of pure desperation in an unjust world.  Jules can protect and guide him, as he knows much of the world.  As Jules said, he would like that.  Jules would like to believe that he is a good person, and could help others with his new-found spirituality.  


  The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men.  But I'm trying.  I'm 
  trying real hard to be the shepard.


Jules recognizes that Ringo isn't a truly bad person at the core: he doesn't want to hurt people (as mentioned in Ringo's speech), he loves his girlfriend, etc.  He is weak, and takes the easy way out by robbing people, but doesn't want to actually hurt people. But that's not the life that Jules has led.  He hasn't tried to avoid hurting people...he has killed many people and thought nothing of it.  Jules has come to realize that he has led the truly evil life.  But he wants to change.  He knows it won't be as easy as just saying it.  ("Now, I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth.")  He has to live it.  And he starts by showing compassion, restraint, and mercy by not only letting Ringo live, but by letting him keep the money...giving him a lesson not of strength, but of generosity.
AnswerKenntnis:
Simple..up until now Jules has been evil...now he's gonna try to do right...which is harder.  You have to remember that this quote comes in the context of Jules quitting the business.

Why was Being John Malkovich based around John Malkovich?
qn_description:
The film Being John Malkovich is replete with unique plot ideas, the most captivating being the portal discovered by Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) taking him into actor John Malkovich's head.

Why did screenwriter Charlie Kaufman select John Malkovich as the person who had a portal to his brain? Furthermore, was Malkovich included in the early discussions involving the production of the film? Would the film have happened if Malkovich balked at the idea?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Charlie Kaufman explains it in an (video) interview with Charlie Rose (skip to 21:00):


  I don't know... I thought it was funny. It's hard to explain, but I
  thought it was funny, but not jokey. Because [John Malkovich] is a serious actor, he
  is a great actor, but there is something odd about him and there is
  something behind his eyes that you can't see. And I thought that was a
  good person for this.
  
  And then I think his name is perfect for the title... when we trying to get the movie made... we didn't know if John was going to do it and Spike [Jonze] and I sort of tried to make a list of other possibilities and there are lots of good actors but nobodys name sounded good in the title... so... it was important for that reason.


As John Malkovich explains in this (video) interview, even though he liked the script from the start, he asked Kaufman 


  if he would make that movie about someone else, that I would like to direct it and we would produce it.


Only several years after that the movie finally got made.

This is also mentioned on the IMDb trivia page:


  John Malkovich was approached about this film several times and loved the script, but he and his production crew felt that another actor would fit the role better. 
  
  Malkovich offered to help produce the film, and aid Spike Jonze in any way, but refused to star in it. 
  
  Eventually after a couple of years Malkovich's will was worn down and he agreed to star in the film.

Kill Bill colour changes to Black and White
qn_description:
In the movie Kill Bill, why does the colour keep shifting from standard colour to black and white? Is it to keep the gross-levels down?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Kill Bill is basically a homage to dozens of films from the past, which were generally shown in black & white on television to cut down on the gore. The same happened to Kill Bill to be able to achieve an R rating and be released in theatres.

IMDB's trivia section confirms this:


  The black and white photography is ultimately an homage to '70s and '80s US television airings of kung fu movies. Black and white (as well as black and red), were used to conceal the shedding of blood from television censors. Originally, no black and white photographic effects were going to be used (and in the Japanese version none are), but the MPAA demanded measures be taken to tone the scene down.
AnswerKenntnis:
No, I don't think it got anything to do with "gross level" - maybe the blood is not red, but body parts still fly around.

My own common sense tells me the goal of this technique is to put more focus on those scenes, draw the viewer attention.

This way those scenes are also much more "artistic" and give the movie whole new layer.. many times those things make the difference between "just another movie" and a cult movie.

Couldn't find any official explanation, so I stick with the above two reasons.
AnswerKenntnis:
in Japan it is in color but no English subtitles for the extensive Japanese, in the film.  It is way better in color.  If i guess at why B&W here in the states it is because of  the gore factor it is not typical Hollywood but realistic or not it is much more hardcore and the B&W tone it down about 1000%  if you are a fan of the movie you owe it to yourself to see the Japanese version
AnswerKenntnis:
I think it concern with the goriness of the scene... If we see the fight the color comes back when Uma Thurman blinks her eye and immediately owner of that place shuts the main power and the color changes to dark blue to minimize the red color of blood.
QuestionKenntnis:
How did Sherlock survive the fall?
qn_description:
In Sherlock, BBC Series, Season 2 Episode 3 - The Reichenbach Fall, how did Sherlock survive the fall? I've read some theories online regarding this, but in this interview, Steven Moffat says "There is a clue everybody's missed". He also says "Yes. We had to have Holmes dying in Watson's arms ΓÇô and get away with that, which we have."

So how? Does anybody know yet?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
He jumped into the truck which was in front of the pavement and drove off as soon as he pushed a body out wearing his clothes or he landed in the truck and then rolled from the truck to the pavement.

Remember how he told Watson exactly where to stand?
(to make sure he could only see from the correct angle)

Watson was delayed by a bicycle hitting him as he ran over.
(to give Holmes and co some extra time)

Watson was pushed back by bystanders telling him not to look?
(so he would not spot any inconsistencies but would see enough)

Suddenly medics appeared and rushed off with the body?
(to prevent Watson, or anyone else, looking too closely)

Holmes remarking to Molly that he needed her?
(either for a spare corpse or to falsely pronounce him dead)

This fits well with the books where Holmes often keeps Watson in the dark, especially as he is a very poor liar.
AnswerKenntnis:
I have my own suspicions about the jump, and I am inclined to believe most explanations are too inelegant for Sherlock to actually perform (and I really do use elegance as my measure of least-most probable).  Thus, any explanation involving body doubles or jumping on a truck or bus, I have a hard time believing.

My theory is that Sherlock JUST DID JUMP.  He did, however, have a means of breaking the fall presumably by the exact same means that helped one of the CIA operatives survive in 'A Scandal in Belgravia'.  If you recall, Sherlock was asked on the phone by Lestrade:


  LESTRADE: And exactly how many times did he fall out the window?
  
  SHERLOCK: ItΓÇÖs all a bit of a blur, Detective Inspector. I lost count.


And from Mrs. Hudson when we hear Neilson fall from the room:


  MRS HUDSON: Ooh. That was right on my bins.


Since we know that the CIA operative (Neilson) was able to survive multiple falls and he was still in standing-condition, I propose that Sherlock did the exact same thing: foreseeing that he was going to have to jump even from a height much higher than what Neilson had to do, he did so but was more severely injured.  The fact that Sherlock also was sitting (rather than standing with a cane) in the final reveal supports this idea.

For me, it's certainly plausible that Sherlock gave the biker some of that hallucinogen to get Watson to believe Sherlock was dead.  However, one thing I don't necessarily understand is why he would have required Watson to be alone in that 'poisoning'...in that if he also got the pedestrians nearby affected, they would further corroborate the idea he fell and died (which is what their suspicions were, likely, anyway).  Of course, it does make sense that he kept Watson so far away (because then he might have identified the means Sherlock had to break his fall).

Molly assuredly was part of the plan (his means to get past the coroners and proclaimed dead) and because of how Irene got proclaimed dead as well, I have every reason to believe Mycroft was in on it, too (explaining his disinterest when he reads about it).

Lastly, I also believe that this would have had to have been convincing EVEN IF Moriarty did not shoot himself, which makes 'jumping onto a truck' less viable...not to mention it seemed clear to me his downward falling trajectory couldn't possibly have landed on the street, anyway.

On a TANGENT, one of the more popular theories I've read was that it was a double and that Hallucinogen + Facemask is how he faked his jump (akin to how the kidnapped children were afraid of Sherlock).  But I refute the facemask idea for reasons of inelegance, as well...not to mention that it seems fairly clear how those children were scared.  Richard Brook was a real persona created by Moriarty (as 'the Reader') in which he used the television show to tell stories of Hansel and Gretel and (though not shown on the series), with a very good likeness of Sherlock over television, condition the two orphans (and probably lots more children!) to be afraid of him when they finally saw him.

That's my theory, anyway.
AnswerKenntnis:
My favourite theory  is akin to the answer given above, but with the extra that when the cycle courier bumped into Watson he exposed him to the chemical from the previous episode that induces hallucinations of that person's worst fear.

It's been a while since I've seen the episode but I do remember that Watson got a clear look at the body on the ground, rolled it over and saw Holmes face. My theory is that by this time the body had already been swapped out, and it was the effects of the hallucinogen that made Watson see the body as Holmes when in fact it was A.N.Other.
AnswerKenntnis:
I don't think anyone can answer this question for sure until the next episode comes out but my observations.

Sherlock asked Molly for help but the audience didn't find out what for.

Moriarty actually told Sherlock he was going to fall!

Sherlock chose the location, not Moriarty

Could the cyclist who hit John be part of the homeless network?
AnswerKenntnis:
There are several things that you had to notice to put this together: 


Sherlock asks for Molly's help. With what? I'm gonna get there in a sec.
Sherlock talked to the homeless network earlier in the episode for unknown reasons.
Sherlock tells Watson exactly where to stand
There is a truck full of garbage bags near the place where Sherlock lands. Before the truck arrive, there is an out of service bus parked in that spot to save it.  You can tell it's out of service because it's parked there for the duration of Sherlock's conversation with Moriarty, and there's even an old man banging on the door with a cane to no avail when Sherlock first stands on the ledge.   
Earlier in the episode, Sherlock is bouncing a ball in the hospital.  
Sherlock calls the reporter, Riley I think her name was...


Sherlock is on the roof of a hospital, meaning that there is no need for an ambulance.  He tells Watson exactly where to stand, and he tells Watson to keep his eyes on him the whole time so that Watson will not notice anything going on at the foot of the building.  Sherlock jumps off the building into the truck.  He could then get out of the truck and lay on the sidewalk.  

The bicyclist that hits Watson is part of the homeless network and hits him to disorient him, so he can't get to the body quickly. Also, the crowd of people that surround Sherlock's body are also homeless network people, because they make it impossible for Watson to see Sherlock's body right away.  

Watson goes to Sherlock's body, and checks the pulse.  He doesn't feel a pulse, but there is an explanation for this.  When the ball Sherlock was bouncing is squeezed between your arm and your body, it makes the feeling of a pulse disappear from your wrist.  Sherlock is rushed into the hospital, which does not let Watson accompany Sherlock, and Molly declares Sherlock dead.  Watson has to believe this because there is a funeral (for closure), and there is no other explanation.
AnswerKenntnis:
The bicyclist is Holmes.
He calls Watson from his cell so he could be anywhere.
Man on ledge is not Holmes he wears the costume Moriarity used to
scare the children and that is what he has returned to Moriarity not the key code.
Homeless (Holmesless) Network and Molly play the parts in the leap of death magic act.
AnswerKenntnis:
In January 2014, Steven Moffat provided some insight in an interview on how Sherlock faked his death:


  As we keep saying to people, I do
  think there was -- I can now say this -- a measure of nonsense going
  on. He's falling off a building. He has one objective -- that is, not
  to hit the sidewalk. That's it. That's the only thing he can do.
  Didn't anybody notice that there's a whole building between John and
  the point of impact? So obviously something got in the way. That's it.
  It wasn't going to be anything else. The TARDIS wasn't going to fly
  in. That wasn't going to happen."


Since Moffat's explanation best corresponds with the final explanation provided in the episode itself, I think the official answer is--disappointingly--that Sherlock jumped on the airbag shown in @howlers answer.

His lackluster answer fails, of course, to explain how the professional sniper was fooled, who apparently completely misses a staged jump with an enormous, brightly-colored airbag and half a dozen men.


  ANDERSON: And what about the sniper aiming at John?  
  
  SHERLOCK: MycroftΓÇÖs men intervened before he could take the shot. He was invited
  to reconsider.


But according to The Reichenbach Fall, on the roof:


  JIM: Okay, let me give you a little extra incentive. 
  
  JIM: Your friends will die if you donΓÇÖt. 
  
  SHERLOCK: John. 
  
  JIM: Not just John. (In a whisper) Everyone. 
  
  SHERLOCK: Mrs Hudson. 
  
  JIM (in a whisper, with a delighted smile): Everyone. 
  
  SHERLOCK: Lestrade. 
  
  JIM: Three bullets; three gunmen; three victims. ThereΓÇÖs no
  stopping them now. 
  
  JIM: Unless my people see you jump.


So, I suppose it's just lucky that while Sherlock was hearing this revelation on the roof for the first time, Mycroft was able to find and neutralize the sniper. Thus, he was able to anticipate the sniper being there and successfully coerce him to call off the other snipers. It's a shame the only eyes he had on Sherlock was a single hired gun rather than the multiple people ("my people") he claimed needed to see Sherlock jump.

Further, if we assume Sherlock was surprised by Moriarty's suicide, one must wonder why any of the corroborators--including Sherlock--could think this would escape the notice of Moriarty himself, who expected to watch Sherlock jump to his death.  He spoke the following words to John, which seems a silly line to lie about:


  SHERLOCK (voiceover): But the one thing I didnΓÇÖt anticipate was just
  how far Moriarty was prepared to go. I suppose that was obvious, given
  our first meeting at the swimming pool ΓÇô his death wish.


Put another way, if Moriarty didn't kill himself, while John's sniper still would've been neutralized, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade's wouldn't have been.

I think Moffat got outmaneuvered by the most fanatic viewers, and conceded early on before filming there were more fitting theories out there, but they were unable/unwilling to pull it off in the timeslot and writing:


  As to the theories that were presented online, Moffat says he is
  aware of them, but that for the most part, the audiences explanations

Going deeper into the meta, I think Moffat knew he was denying us sufficient closure. As we as viewers find holes in the story and receive no answers, Andersen finds holes in the story and Sherlock abruptly disappears, leaving Andersen to completely break down. Of course, Sherlock fanatics are Andersen in this metaphor. /fanaticism
AnswerKenntnis:
He used an inflatable crashmat hidden by a low building, and a cyclist who deliberately knocked John to the ground, buying time for Molly and members of Sherlock's "homeless network" to bloody up his ΓÇ£deadΓÇ¥ body and take away the crashmat , The squash ball under the arm to mask Sherlock's pulse ΓÇô a technique used on stage by Gatiss's friend Derren Brown was used when watson checked for a pulse
AnswerKenntnis:
Sherlock Holmes asks Molly (the coroner girl) for a favour knowing he would die, so he got her to take a dead body and put a mask of Sherlock on it. When Holmes jumps, there is a red bus parked underneath, filled with bags to soften his fall, and he had Molly dump a body when he would land. The reason why the biker pushed Watson over was so that he didnΓÇÖt see the body switch. One can tell, because Sherlock jumps when thereΓÇÖs no one around and also because Watson checks for a pulse, which means that the body was dead, and not Sherlock knowing he would survive the fall.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why does James Bond keep demanding a vodka martini that is shaken but not stirred?
qn_description:
Is there a difference between a shaken and stirred vodka martini? Maybe some scientific explanation? (while not overtly sci-fi, there are a lot of sci-fi elements in Bond movies)

It would also make some sense if the the olive was added before the shaken/stirring as really hard shaking could manage to squeeze out the essence/oils from the oil and mix it with the alcohol, but from what I have heard, you don't do that.

See this, as a reminder of the legacy
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
There are several reasons why Bond would order his drink 'shaken, not stirred'.

Firstly, he might prefer a colder drink, as shaking a martini will certainly result in a colder beverage. However, this causes the drink to lose its clarity due to the tiny ice chips and is often frowned upon by 'connoisseurs' who claim this 'bruises' the gin.

Secondly, it is recorded that Ian Fleming was a fan of of shaken martinis - particularly ones made by Gilberto Preti, a bartender in Dukes Hotel, London.

If you are looking for a scientific reason, then it is claimed that a shaken martini results in a drink with marginally more antioxidants in it - which must make it a bit healthier :)
There are a few more reasons cited in this interesting article from the Royal Society of Chemistry, including the breakdown of the oils found in cheaper vodkas from Bond's era.
AnswerKenntnis:
I remember watching a MythBusters episode testing if there is a perceptible difference, resulting in an affirmation that there is a difference. And the Wikipedia article on ΓÇ£Shaken, not stirredΓÇ¥ contains a whole section explaining a lot, including a claim that Fleming liked his martinis shaken, not stirred because Fleming thought that stirring a drink diminished its flavour.
AnswerKenntnis:
A: Because the writers wanted to give Bond style.

You asked for the ΓÇ£scienceΓÇ¥, and the answers so far reflect that.  To me this misses the point entirely.  IΓÇÖm interested in the artistic decisions, as they are more relevant to the movie series:

1.) Cocktails are all about taste and style, (not unlike print typeface.)  Bond drinks the most debonair cocktail - a Martini.  ItΓÇÖs the mixed drink equivalent of a black tuxedo or an Aston Martin DB5.  (Albeit a martini is a distinctly American invention.)

2.) However, James prefers Vodka.  This implies an affiliation and taste for things Russian ΓÇô not insignificant at the height of the Cold War to have a British agent prefer Russian vodka to British gin.  In the sixties thatΓÇÖs a big statement; and in the 60ΓÇÖs they didnΓÇÖt have a vodka from every nation like it seems today.

3.) ΓÇÿShaken not stirredΓÇÖ underlines further BondΓÇÖs rapscallion nature.  To my mind, this is way more significant artistically than any molecular scientific understanding of the differences.

If the gag was Bond wants a cold but unbruised drink, they might have just chilled the glasses and the vermouth better.  Also, looking at the YouTube link in the OP, I was surprised to see that Bond makes an uncharacteristic mistake (read: the writers ΓÇô twice!)  A martini is a martini.  A vodka martini is a vodka martini.  You do not ask for, ΓÇ£a martiniΓÇ¥ and expect, a.) there to be vodka in it, and b.) a reputable bartender to ask you if you want vodka in it.  The correct drink request is ΓÇ£vodka martiniΓÇ¥, then qualified simply ΓÇ£shaken, [not stirred].ΓÇ¥

And, no, a chocolate martini is not a martini ΓÇô itsΓÇÖ a chocolate martini.  A ΓÇ£martiniΓÇ¥ with zero vermouth is not a martini ΓÇô itΓÇÖs gin.  (Hence all the whimsical jokes about minimal vermouth (by ΓÇ£just waving a bottle over itΓÇ¥) for a very dry martini ΓÇô vs. just a ΓÇ£no vermouth pleaseΓÇ¥.)  ItΓÇÖs a kind of unwritten but very traditional and long standing Reinheitsgebot law for martinis.  A martini is: gin, dry vermouth, an olive or lemon twist garnish.  Full-stop.  (There is nothing ΓÇÿrapscallionΓÇÖ about not knowing how to order a drink correctly.)

Final thoughts:


I read somewhere the liquor used for Bond films was actually ginger ale for champagne, watered down coffee for whiskey, and pure water for Bond's trademarked vodka martini.
In You Only Live Twice, Mr. Henderson gets the line backwards but they keep it in the film.  He says ΓÇ£Stirred not Shaken.ΓÇ¥  (Also, wearing his slippers on the tatami mats is lame.  [Bond is in just socks.])
Not about drink, but this song is an all-time cine favorite (pretty great movie too!).  But when I think of Bond movies I often pine on the opportunities where that 1971 Ennio Morricone song could have been used.  (The song name is #21 - Tarantola Dal Ventre Nero  The connection is that the original movie has two Bond girls in it.)


These are just hard won thoughts.  Nothing to back me up online that I know of.  Necropost.  Sorry.
QuestionKenntnis:
What was the first movie to introduce "blue wire or red wire" bomb disposal?
qn_description:
I have seen Juggernaut (1974) recently. There is a scene in the end of the movie when the bomb disposal expert, Fallon has to choose one of the two wires (red or blue) to cut in order to disarm the bomb. Finally, Fallon makes a choice by intuition. 

I have seen the similar scenes in several other movies (one of the parts of Die Hard, for example).

So, my questions are: What was the first movie to introduce "cut the wire" bomb disposal? Is it Juggernaut itself?

A quick search on Google and IMDB didn't reveal any info.
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
A lot of people seem to think Juggernaut is the earliest film to use the "wire dilemma" trope.  I found references to it everywhere from Amazon reviews to rap lyrics.  Slightly more reliable references include:

Movies you should own: Juggernaut (Terror on the Britannic)


  The first film to develop the 'red wire/blue wire' dilemma, it's a tense piece directed by Richard 'Superman II' Lester, with dialogue by Alan 'Beiderbecke' Plater, that while featuring an all-star cast is in reality a mesmerising monologue by Harris and a musing on the nature of death. It's a movie you should own.


JUGGERNAUT (1974) - a very British disaster movie


  There's a scene in the film that's famous, but you probably donΓÇÖt realise it was shown here first. Where the crucial decision has to be made ΓÇô to cut the blue wire or the red wire.


It's also the oldest film listed in Televison Tropes - Wire Dilemma article.
AnswerKenntnis:
One of the "deleted scenes" in Griffith's 1915 silent The Birth of a Nation had a red wire/blue wire bomb defusing dilemma.  The scene was cut because the color issue didn't work in a B&W film.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why do movies still have credits?
qn_description:
I asked my friends and none of them remembers having ever watched the credits after a movie to the end, except where the movie still continues after credits start rolling (short comic pieces or "what happened to the characters afterwards" short sequences or there was a special after-credits scene.) Anyway, none of them ever watched the credits for the sake of reading through all of the names.

In theaters, people usually just get up and leave when the credits start. I stayed several times until the very end just to see people who are talking to each other, lazing around or have fallen asleep. Nobody really was looking at the screen.

Credits seem to have become to people even less important than EULA for games and apps. They are also bloated with jobs that are remotely related to making of the movie.

There seem to be a few important messages like "no animals were harmed" or "pure fiction" or "tricks done by professionals" to be conveyed, which can be done in just a few seconds, but these are often put in the very end of the credits.

Credits seem to have originated a long time ago when there weren't that many people involved in making a movie and most roles were important enough for people to want to find out who they were done by. And it didn't take that much time to show every job. Now everyone seems to be only interested in actors, director, composer and a few others who are usually shown in opening credits and on movie posters.

I doubt somebody would want to know who was some fourth cameraman's assistant. All these positions must only be significant to the movie-making community, which probably has easy access to that info, and I don't see why it would interest normal viewers.

Why even have credits now?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Summary:


Legal/contractual obligations to list all staff who've worked on film
Evidence that staff have worked on film, which can be used to help them gain future employment
Some movie-goers are extremely interested in credits and finding out who was responsible for what


Detailed Answer:

Union Rules/legalities

E! Online were asked a question about why movie credit were so long and as part of their answer stated:


  "Films have always employed dozens (if not hundreds) of people in
  various jobs," Clark University director of screen studies Tim Shary
  tells this B!tch. "But before the '60s, they tended to be in teams,
  and usually only the leader of the unit received onscreen credit. So,
  the art director would be listed but not all of the people (painters,
  decorators, landscapers, carpenters, etc.) that worked for him or her.
  "Now, almost everyone who works on a film is a member of a union, and
  they have expectations about getting onscreen credit."
  
  Could a director like Spielberg or a producer like Scott Rudin decide
  to eliminate those credits during one of his 18 daily ego meltdowns?
  Not likely, I'm told. During film's golden age, most movie workers
  were under contract to a studio, so the suits could credit their
  drones--or not--as they saw fit. Today, people hire themselves out
  film by film, giving them and their unions more power.
  
  "The presence of many credits today are adjudicated by unions and
  guilds," says Penn State senior film lecturer Kevin J. Hagopian. "So,
  Steven Spielberg, even as a producer, could not decide simply to leave
  off these names."
  
  ...One other factor: cheaper movies. Black-turtlenecked indie fans
  love to joke that the size of a small film's credits is inversely
  proportional to the size of its budget. (What, you expected these
  people to have a real sense of humor?) Instead of paying cash,
  indie-film producers often offer key spaces in their credits as a
  thank-you.
  
  "When freelancing replaced the studio contract system, studios and
  producers realized they could pay people less if they gave them
  credit," San Francisco State University film professor Joseph McBride
  says. "So, the proliferation of credits went bananas in the '70s and
  '80s, to the point that now even the honey-wagon driver is credited."


So there does appear to be legalities involved in having people gain credits. Some examples of this can be seen for particular "groups":


Writer's Guild
Producer's Guild


Acknowledgement used as a form of intellectual property

Quoting directly from Wikipedia, which rather nicely sums it up:


  In the creative arts and scientific literature, an acknowledgment
  (also spelled acknowledgement) is an expression of gratitude for
  assistance in creating an original work. 
  
  Receiving credit by way of
  acknowledgment rather than authorship indicates that the person or
  organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in
  question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or
  encouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying
  acknowledgments; Cronin et al.give the following six categories:
  
  a) moral support
  b) financial support
  c) editorial support
  d) presentational
  support
  e) instrumental/technical support
  f) conceptual support, or peer
  interactive communication (PIC) 
  
  Apart from citation, which is not
  usually considered to be an acknowledgment, acknowledgment of
  conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for
  identifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgments of financial
  support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by
  the granting institution.


So it appears many people, from actors through to cameramen, can use the fact they are included in credits as a form of "proof" on their CV so to speak, to absolutely guarantee they were involved in a project in that particular role.

An example of this on a minor stage, is the IMDB Credit System, which explicitly states that anyone can add their name as an actor to a film, but their system will check it against the official "credits" and remove it if not featured.

Public interest

Whilst I imagine the majority of film watchers do not watch the end credits, there are a some who do (call them Dawsons) and are genuinely interested in how a particular part of a film was achieved (e.g. how a sound effect was completed or who was in charge of animal safety, etc).

Edit:

To add in some of the fantastic points made in the comments:

Tom: People want acknowledgement for their hard work with a place in the credits, regardless of whether the audience will watch it.

Damon: The credits add to the length of the movie which increases the amount of money it can be licensed to broadcasters for.

Claudio Miklos: The credits are a piece of film history, recording for all time exactly who did what with a film.
AnswerKenntnis:
In general sense, movies still need credits because every single person who worked very hard for the movie needs recognition.

I still remember, Danny Boyle who got an Oscar award for Best Achievement in Directing for Slumdog Millionaire mentioned Longinus Fernandes  for forgetting his name in the credits and thanked him.


  At the 81st Academy Awards ceremony, director Danny Boyle thanked Longinus Fernandes in his acceptance speech, while receiving his award for Best Direction, and also acknowledge missing out Longinus Fernandes name in the credits.


Check this for Danny Boyle's Oscar acceptance speech.
AnswerKenntnis:
Aside from the many valid issues found in Andrew's answer, there are a couple other considerations:


Showmanship:
The movie going experience is a show and every detail counts. What happens when the credits roll? 


As you said, people leave. They gather their bags, stretch. The soundtrack is still playing, the lights are still dimmed but are progressively turned on. People start heading for the door at their own pace. For the few movies who hit the mark, people linger and enjoy to the last bit the movie going experience, especially those with a great score - without your attention on the story and the action on screen, the soundtrack shines through.

Consider the alternative: display "the end", cut off the sound and turn on the lights? After a couple hours in the dark, turning on the lights at once would hurt the eyes. Obviously the lights have to remain somewhat dimmed, but with nothing on the screen, it's a bit weird, no? Same for the sound: you can continue playing the soundtrack specifically composed to match the mood of the film and the expected mood of the spectator at the end of the film, or you can cut off the sound or play whatever music the theater chooses. 
People need a couple minutes to adjust themselves to the fact the movie is over and get back to their day to day life. 
Rolling credits exists for historical reasons, but it does also serve a purpose: it's the perfect transition from the film's fictional world and reality. 


No harm done. 


Once everyone is out, whether there is still 15 seconds of credits or 20 minutes makes no difference: the projectionist turns off the projector. As such the full length of the credits is never an issue in theater.


Learning opportunity - Gives a good grasp on what it takes to get a movie done.  


It's a more geeky reason, but for some movies, I like to see how they organized the various teams and how much personnel they assigned for specific tasks.
AnswerKenntnis:
Up until circa the 1960s movies didn't have end credits. The director, writer and main cast were credited in the title sequence at the beginning, and movies ended with a simple "THE END" title.

This was during the studio system, when films were produced in house by crews employed directly by the studio on a long term basis. These studio employees weren't credited separately on screen for every film they worked on.

After the collapse of the studio system, the studios (MGM, Paramount, Universal etc.) stopped producing films themselves; they turned into financing and distribution companies; the production of films was farmed out separate production companies, who hire crew for each production they work on.

As the crews who work on films are no longer permanent studio employees but are put together for each film, the unions have negotiated that everybody who works on a film receives an on-screen credit, as a record of previous experience is an important basis for finding future employment.
QuestionKenntnis:
Why is James Bond less tech savvy in the Daniel Craig movies?
qn_description:
The most recent installments of James Bond (ones featuring Daniel Craig) have fewer gadgets but more raw action (like the chase sequences in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace). Is it because of plot related changes to the MI:6 or have the movies been altered to suit the audiences?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
I don't think it had any plot driven change.  The Bond franchise was feeling threatened by newer spy movies (such as the Bourne series) which have more action, (slightly) more plausible plots (compared to ray-gun satellites etc), and have less comedic elements.

A reboot with a new younger actor and a deliberate step away from some of the conventions of the franchise (gadgets & moneypenny for example) were their answer.

They tried to take  it this direction before - a Licence to Kill was a deliberate attempt with a drug-smuggling and revenge plot-line, but wasn't well done.  They then decided to switch back to more 'classic' Bond approaches with Brosnan.
AnswerKenntnis:
Love the other answers already given but one extra contributory factor may be that, and you may not remember this, there was a huge backlash against 'Die Another Day's over-use of frankly bullshit technology and the makers commented at the time that they knew they'd gone too far. In particular the invisible car was just laughed at when I saw it theatrically, as was the huge laser that could destroy land targets but seemed to only warm up the plane gradually, plus the ice-hotel, the VR headset and a number of other items that not only didn't add anything but actually made the filme laughable.
AnswerKenntnis:
The new movies starring Daniel Craig were intended as a reboot of the series.  As part of that reboot it seems that they have moved away from having so many gadgets and are focusing more on the character's own abilities.
AnswerKenntnis:
After seeing the preview to the new movie Skyfall, I think there might be another possible explanation.  In the preview, they introduce Q for the first time in the reboot. They also seem to imply that Q is going to "revitalize" MI6, maybe with more emphasis on tech support instead of purely physical methods of getting information (as Daniel Craig has done in the earlier movies). Perhaps there are not as many gadgets because this reboot emphasizes the beginning of 007 and is before Q is there to create the gadgets.
AnswerKenntnis:
I don't think Bond is less "tech savvy" in the new Bond films. It is a definite move away from the Moore/Brosnan era. The new approach to the character is less tech driven and moves more toward the literary character. Although the Bourne films can be credited for the more gritty fight scenes and slick editing, you only have to look back at From Russia with Love and On Her Majesty's Secret Service for early examples of this style of Bond. Both of these Bond films were credited to be nearer the literary character than any other and were also very low tech in comparison to other movies. It would seem that the Daniel Craig Bond is a step in this direction which (for me) is a very good thing.

What is the significance of the narrator's fight and Tyler Durden's subsequent actions?
qn_description:
In the movie Fight Club (1999), the narrator (often referred to as "Jack") struggles to keep up with and understand his alter-ego's actions and motives. 

In one scene, he loses his head and pounds the daylights out of a blond-headed man who had recently received Tyler's praise. Tyler reacts somewhere between disgust and surprise at this behavior, asking him "Where'd you go psycho boy?" 

Shortly after this, Jack stops being aware of his alter-ego at all, perceived by him as Tyler leaving. What is the significance of this scene? Is Jack jealous over the praise the other man received? Is there another explanation? Does Jack secretly want to be Tyler?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
It appears to me that the narrator is becoming jealous of Tyler's relationship with others in Project Mayhem, and that this results in his explosive burst of anger in the fight.  He also expresses some desire to break something beautiful - he perceives both Tyler and the blond to be more attractive than himself.  However, I am not entirely sure I can link the fight with the events following where Tyler appears to go on lots of trips.

I think it is easier to link this with the fact that he perceives that his own importance is being increasingly diminished.  He founded Fight Club with Tyler, but Project Mayhem is much more Tyler's idea and the group looks more to Tyler.  So his jealousy towards the blond haired guy is secondary in my mind to his desire to me more involved in the leadership of Project Mayhem.

Tyler is increasingly becoming everything that the narrator is not - charismatic, attractive, uninhibited, powerful .... and the narrator is becoming increasingly bitter and jealous about this.  It is almost like as Tyler becomes more the opposite of the narrator the less the two are able to perceive each other, and one inhabits the other half of the day from each other.
AnswerKenntnis:
Jack is jealous.  I just went back and watched it, and the scene preceding that is the bathroom scene.  After they all run out, Tyler pats Angel Face on the back and smiles at him, and the narrator says "I am Jack's burning sense of rejection" or something along those lines.  So he beats Angel Face up out of jealousy.

Is Batman Begins based on any Batman comic or was it entirely written from scratch?
qn_description:
Were Batman Begins or The Dark Knight based on any particular comic(s) or was were they completely created from scratch?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Batman Begins is a combination of stories from the Batman mythos, as well as an original story. According to Wikipedia, the starting point for Batman Begins was a story called "The Man Who Falls"; Jim Gordon was based on the character from the story "Batman: Year One". Neither of these stories featured Ra's Al Ghul, who is a significantly different character than the one featured in the comic (both Ra's are leaders of a large group of assassins, and both have a large respect for Batman, but the Ra's in the comics is depicted as being hundreds of years old, regenerating himself in a pool of liquid called "The Lazarus Pit". It remains to be seen if the Ra's in the movie makes a similar comeback or not).

The film The Dark Knight uses elements from the story The Long Halloween, though again the story is mainly an original story. It was also related that Heath Ledger, who played The Joker, locked himself in his hotel room for weeks to try and get to the core of the character of The Joker, even writing a journal of The Joker's 'thoughts'.

What does the woman from the future mean when she says she's "in insurance"?
qn_description:
At the end of 12 Monkeys, the doctor spreading the virus gets on a plane and sits next to a woman we know (or can assume) is from the future. She tells the doctor that she's "in insurance."  What does she mean by this?

Is she there to make sure he's stopped once and for all?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
The caricature of insurance people is that they are like leeches -- that they make their living off of people's fear. Mortality rates and actuarials are not appealing topics. Their paradox is that without tragedy, insurance wouldn't be a viable business.  

This conception has existed for years -- well before the bad behavior and negative publicity insurance companies have earned over the past decade. Denying coverage or revoking claims for profit.

Terry Gilliam does what he has always done, and does best! The line "I'm in insurance" is a punchline, absurdism pure and simple. Maximum irony: That insurance woman scores on ultimate tragedy. She is not only immune to the virus, but she prospers in such a way as to become a post-apocalyptic ruler. Ha!

[see Fight Club for a big send-up of greedy insurers]
AnswerKenntnis:
She is "insurance" that the virus will successfully be spread around the world. 

The key is that the scientists were never interested in stopping the virus in 1995. As Cole says early on, "I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth."

But later Cole decides to stay in 1995, and by the airport scene, he has given the future scientists the slip by cutting out his teeth. Except Cole leaves a message from the airport, leading the future scientists back to him -- with a two-part plan:


Cole's message did not identify the virus spreader, so Jose's task at airport is to give Cole the gun and then watch who Cole goes after. When Catherine runs up and says she's figured out it is the redhead assistant to Dr Goynes who spreads the virus, Jose fades out of the scene, having got what he needed. (for confirmation see scene as written in production draft of script)
From there, the scientists need to make sure Cole does not actually prevent the virus from being spread because that would dramatically disrupt the timeline. To prevent the disruption, the lady scientist is sent as back-up who -- if Cole somehow manages to stop redhead-ponytail guy -- can grab the briefcase, take the flights, and make sure the virus still gets spread around the world (which seems to end up being unnecessary because redhead-ponytail gets on plane OK)


Luckily for the scientists, airport security shoots Cole when Cole tries to shoot the redhead guy. (The scientists may have provided Cole a non-working gun to encourage this outcome.)

More evidence:


the lady scientist says insurance remark on the plane seated next
to redhead-ponytail guy, suggesting she was prepared to go to the
same destinations, which the scientists had Cole list earlier in the movie
the scientists may have been worried because Pitt's father changing security procedures, showing Cole could indeed disrupt timeline.
at one point, a scientist in the future scornfully calls the pre-virus world "that dying world" suggesting no interest in saving it.
the overall story of the movie is Cole wants to live in the past despite being ordered not to (Cole: "This part isn't about the virus, is it? It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.")
AnswerKenntnis:
Cole's assignment was not to stop the virus, but to locate the source.  The insurance person I believe was sent to get a sample.  The virus will spread, because it already has.  The goal to the time travelers was to figure out (in the future) how to combat the virus.

Edit: Here is my take on how time travel works (IMHO); Anything that is known in the future is what happened in the past.  Therefore you can't change the past except in ways that don't make the future inconsistent with the past.  Cole knew about the man (himself) being shot at the airport and I think that the controller that sent Cole into the past also knew and most likely guessed that he was Cole.  They also sent Jose with the gun to help Cole to fulfill his destiny.
What the controllers want is a way to cure the virus in their time and they need a sample to be able to do that.  The insurance lady is there to get the sample.  This lady has to be from the future and not her younger self or she would have contracted the virus and died, therefore she would not be in the future.
Another indicator that she was from the future is that Cole was 8 years old at the time, Jose when he gave the Cole the gun said something that 30 years had passed (although I think that more then 30 years had passed as Cole looks to be older than 38).  The age of the insurance lady didn't appear to be 30+ years younger than the future version.
AnswerKenntnis:
Yes, just in-case they couldn't stop him in the airport, she is the backup...insurance. At least that's how I interpreted it.
AnswerKenntnis:
I actually always saw this as coincidence with her being the "original past version" of this woman, who's unaware of her future.

Whereas your interpretation makes much more sense I have a major problem with it: causality! They cannot stop the outspread of the virus because this would prevent Bruce Willis' and her future actions and therefore the whole movie and their stopping of the virus. And he already let it free in the airport when he opened the glass, didn't he?

Well most movies about time travel don't care about such causality problems, but especially Twelve Monkies is one of the few films (or the only one? maybe Source Code in its own theoretical physical interpretation) I know that handle causality in a plausible way. So I'm pretty sure in the context/story/universe of the movie they cannot prevent the outspread of the virus because all their actions are already prescribed, like Bruce Willis' death in the airport has always been prescribed.

But well your interpretation still makes sense, so I think they could still try to stop him (the characters are still unaware of the causality problems) without success or even heal it in the future, where the story is still open.

So yes, she's likely to be the insurance to stop him. But again, she will not be able to achieve it.

EDIT: In my coincidence-interpretation the "insurance" remarks could also be just a symbol for her, one of the scientists/leaders, being an ordinary citizen in the past, in this case an insurance agent. Similar to the symbol of the Holnist leader being a former copier salesman in The Postman.

Is this because of Stark's Arc Reactor countering the Cosmic powers somehow, because Stark is incorruptible (which doesn't make much sense), or possibly because simply he was touching the Arc Reactor and not Stark's flesh?

Either way, is there an explanation of why this did not work on Tony?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
When Loki tries to take control of Stark he actually hits the ARC reactor and not the flesh over his heart.  Your graphic explains it best with the "Tink, Tink" sound showing that Loki is actually hitting the metal of the reactor.

In the Avengers director commentary, Joss Whedon states it fails to work because the ARC reactor prevents the staff from reaching Tony's heart.
AnswerKenntnis:
Remember: Stark's father was studying the power of the cube. In Iron Man 2 he said only Tony could accomplish the creation of this new particle. It could have been a tesseract particle of some sort that Tony made with his new reactor. This could be why the spear of Loki didn't affect Stark. Just the same as the spear could affect the closing of the portal.
AnswerKenntnis:
From my point of view there are some facts that seem to interfere: 


Even though the Spear and Cube are known as mystical and magical items, they are used to tap into a source of almost universal convertable energy. An energy similar to the emitted power generated by the Arc Reactor. The two energies, if not even the same seem to interfere each other. 
It is known that the Arc Reactor is able to store and absorb large amounts of energy. So it is possible that it absorbed the low frequency energy normally used to correspond and control the victims brain patterns. 
As seen the Arc Reactor is not only touched by the spear/scepter but it's attracting it in a magnet-like manner. In my opinion the reactor is emitting an electromagnetic field that is attracting the spear as well as interfering the energy projection which is causing the spear's ability to control the victim's brain patterns.

What do actors actually inhale when they snort cocaine or smoke crack?
qn_description:
While film scenes where an actor injects something into his/her arm can perhaps be faked with edits and maybe prosthetics, how do actors manage to snort cocaine or smoke crack? Are there approved safe alternatives that are used?



Also, considering the lifestyles of many actors, are there any instances where actors have used the real deal?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Because of powdered milk's resemblance to cocaine and other drugs, powdered milk is sometimes used in film-making as a non-toxic prop that may be inhaled.

Other methods listed on nypost.com are -


  
  ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs usually cornstarch, but you have to put a bit of baby powder
  into it, because starch is too sticky and heavy,ΓÇ¥ says Gillian

  Colin Farrell didnΓÇÖt seem to mind. He was even snorting the powder
  off-camera in order to stay in character, Bates says.
  For the lactose-intolerant, something like a vitamin B powder (inositol),
  available at health-food stores, might be substituted.
  
  
  Snorting any powder over multiple takes can cause an actor to become

QuestionKenntnis:
K-PAX ending explanation
qn_description:
In K-PAX, there are two possible explanations:


Prot is crazy.
He is truly an alien.


There are facts that indicate 1, but also 2.
Examples:


  He seems to respond to hypnosis, has a sort of phobia of water, looks just like his friend and doesn't physically leave. But he sees UV rays, finds his planet and in the end makes the other patient (Bess) vanish.


How should the whole movie be interpreted, especially the ending?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Prot is human


Prot has a human subconscious
Prot has a human history (e.g. the school book, and the probable trauma)
Prot remains on earth after July 27th


Prot is an alien inhabiting a disturbed human's body


He can see ultraviolet rays (perhaps through the glasses)
He has an astounding knowledge of astronomy, physics, and advanced psychology (cures patients of serious mental illnesses that are equal to his own if he were human)
The electrical disturbance on the surveillance when he 'left'
He managed to disappear and survive unnoticed for almost 5 years since the incident.
He evaded security and left for 3 days completely unnoticed.
He left Bess's letter on her bed before she disappeared, confirming some sort of interaction that allowed her to disappear unnoticed on July 27th. (Perhaps he told her of a way to breach security)


Prot was an ET and could travel through a light beam in human body physical form but only one at a time. Hence, "I can only take one of you" ultimately choosing Bess.
Robert Porter was Prot's human friend before suffering mental trauma and becoming catatonic so Prot occupied his body to protect him and travel through until he could deliver him from peril after finding the right caretaker (Dr. Powell), then catching his prearranged travel timed Lightbeam Home using Bess as his human form (Vehicle), leaving Robert in safe haven with Dr. Powell. That's my synopsis.

Regardless, Prot acknowledges his return to consciousness with Jeff Bridges, asking that he take care of him. To me this says that although Prot may be an alien in Robert's body, he may still maintain some of the human subconsciousness.
For these reasons I find the clues are more consistent with the possibility that he is an Alien, than he is not. Funny enough to say, it would be almost more convoluted to argue that he was human.
AnswerKenntnis:
I think it's sort of like the endings of movies like "Inception", "Fried Green Tomatoes", and "12 Angry Men" where we, as the audience, are not given all the answers.  I think he really was an alien, but I like that the film leaves enough ambiguity and mystery to let us think about it and decide on our own what to believe, rather than just spoon-feeding audiences every answer.
AnswerKenntnis:
There are some parts that could be considered as "weird" and used as "for" or "against" for the theory that Prot was an alien.

When he is "talking" with the dog, when the security cam stopped working at 5:51am sharp on 27th of July when he was supposed to leave, Bess's disappearance and maybe some other that I can't remember at the moment. But there is no proof that he actually did understand that dog. There is no proof that the security cam didn't just stop working by an accident. 

There is no proof that Bess went to K-PAX. She could've taken the chance when everyone was rushing to Prot's room and sneak out (but again why would she?). I just wonder how he could know that much about some distant galaxy (that even top scientists didn't know at that time - according to the movie) if he is not an alien. 

That drawing with formulas that positioned planets in that galaxy exactly is something that even the scientists couldn't explain. There could be an explanation if he was a former scientist who had some advanced knowledge and in some point of time went crazy and mixed reality with imagination, but he was a worker at some meat packing plant... So, this is the only thing in the whole movie that gives me a lot of confusion.
AnswerKenntnis:
Prot was a spirit who was Robert porters guardian Angel over the course of his life . Robert porter over his years would pray and ask for guidance and help when in need and prot would come to take care of him and offer him guidance 

Proat loved fruit  and was especially interested in the red delicious apple in the psycologist office because where he is from someone ate an apple in the garden of eden and got in big trouble (eve) 

Prots report was some of the mistakes he made in his life on earth that he had to fix 

He traveled by light , the same thing it is said that we see and walk towards when our spirits pass on after our death.

The one patient was cured of his problem of not going outside wearing a mask for protection etc when prot instructed the other patient with the glasses to strangle him so he would die and be brought back , showing him that there is something great that happens after death and not to waste his time being afraid of dying 

The mental patients saw prot as the Angel he was,   not robert ,  because there minds were more open to seeing things that you cant really explain .. this explains there comments of "whos that guy " thats definitely not prot  when Roberts body was taken out of thre room after prot left him .

The last comments on the movie about the world expanding and contracting refer to birth and death

Having to repeat youre journey over and over untill you get all your mistakes right is reffering to the journey we all are on untill we serve gods purpose here ,  and get invited back to our home  heaven. 
If  we get it right the first time ...we dont have to keep coming back like he did untill  we get it right.

K PAX was inference to  heaven  not a planet
AnswerKenntnis:
I've developed somewhat of a theory over the years since its release in 2001.
Many times throughout the films, there's an indication towards Dr. Powell's failed attempt at a marriage, the first time around. I've always wondered as to why this was mentioned, what significance could this possibly hold? That it's questionable as to whether Dr. Powell should be considered to having his life in order?

Sure, Dr. Powell has a beautiful wife and two cute kids, and another whom we don't see till the end of the film played by the fabulous Aaron Paul... but what relevance does this past marriage have?

My opinion, which may be somewhat outlandish, is that Dr. Powell is Robert Porter.

Robert Porter vanished five years ago, and yet Kevin Spacey's role as Prot seems unbelievably close in age to Dr. Powell. Could they have been childhood friends? Apparently, Robert's father was a keen astronomer; something which a member of Dr. Powell's family is also proficient in.

Maybe Prot has returned with complete knowledge of where Robert Porter/Powell had setup his new life - in New York as a psychologist. One could argue how someone would be able to become an obviously well-respected psychologist in 5 years, on top of building a family; but even here - we don't know if Powell's daughters are biologically related to him, and either of them may be under/around the age of 5. Powell also has a dream about the twilight planet of K-PAX, which may be a clue that he's also travelled with Prot at some point or another, and that this warping of time may have afflicted him also.

Powell also had his previous failed marriage, but there's no indication as to what the cause of this was; only that he and his son Michael have developed an alienated relationship.

There were other clues throughout the years I have considered and mulled over, but I don't think it was the intent of the DOP to have people wondering the truth behind it all. I suppose in the end it is quite evident that Prot IS really Robert Porter (the first clue, obviously, being that Prot is an anagram for the first four letters of Porter).
AnswerKenntnis:
The way the director wants to present it is that this really could be happening and the hinges that he is a human is just the stuff that the sceptics (most of us) feed off as an excuse that it's just a scam. The way I see it though is that he really is a K-PAXian and posseses a body in order to live and travel to/from earth (Robert's body on the way to earth and leaving with Bess' body).
AnswerKenntnis:
Prot is Human

Prot created the double ego the first time he went through a shock he couldn't handle when his father died. After that he bought a telescope and kept going with his life establishing the facts regarding the second ego at the periods of crisis. After his wife and daughter died, which was the worst crisis, 5 years passed that we do not know what he was doing. His was clever enough and obsessed enough to have been searching and studying about the spedific planet so as to conclude in facts that scientists hadn't. He wrote laws of physics and mathematics so he may had been studying these as well. When he was under hypnosis he reffered to his other ego as a friend. 

When Prot travelled through a light beam, he didn't need mass. That's why he left Robert behind. If that is so, why Bess needed a human body to go to K-Pax? As i see it, he just gave her strength to run free. 

The camera happened to not to be working at the moment and the bluebird may had been a mass paroxysm.
AnswerKenntnis:
Prot is Robert's guardian angel. He clearly says he comes when he needs help and he leaves him with Dr. Powell and takes Bess's body because she needs his help now.
AnswerKenntnis:
If Robert Porter's body was being inhabited by an alien that traveled far faster than the speed of light, which no human body could withstand, how was Prot traveling on earth for 5 years in Robert Porter's body? In the movie he went up north and was missing from the psych ward for three days. How did he travel in Robert's body? Robert Porter's body just appeared in the train station. How? The movie leaves this unanswered.
AnswerKenntnis:
Prot is from K-Pax.

He came down from K-Pax to help a friend whom he had been in contact with many times in previous visits (As Peter was also very smart).

Prot took over the body of Peter, (saved from drowning) to try and keep him alive to help him, which as it turned out in the end Prot could not (then gave him to the human Dr to look after), the loss was to great after the death of his wife and child.

Now why he chose Bess, she suffered the same sort of illness from much the same sort of emotional incident (loss of family). If there was a K-Pax 2, Bess would be the Prot from K-Pax.

The thing I like about this movie is this: We just don't know anything for sure.

We humans think we are smart, but we are nothing in the time frame of the universe and so very na├»ve. There could easy be other life forms out there far more advanced than us. We assume because we have not discovered it yet that light is not a means for energy, that time travel or intergalactic travel is not possible...but it could be as we don't know everything. In just even 500 years from now, our knowledge would have grown massively.
QuestionKenntnis:
In Back to the Future Part II, how could old Biff have made it back to 2015?
qn_description:
So in Back to the Future Part II, Doc picks up Marty in 1985 and takes him to 2015. Then old Biff realizes the Delorean is a time machine. Old Biff steals the Delorean and travels from 2015 to 1955 to give the 1955 version of himself the 2015 sports almanac. 

But when old Biff then returned to 2015 from 1955, shouldn't he have arrived in a way-different 2015? Instead, he arrives in the same 2015 that he departed, where Doc and Marty are still running around as if nothing changed.

update1: here's pic of Doc Brown in BTTF2 explaining how Old Biff created new timeline


update 2: After pondering more, I think this is a problem created by perspective. When Old Biff takes the Delorean back in time, we viewers do not go along for the ride. We're left hanging in a 2015 that becomes obsolete when Old Biff changes 1955. Seems our 2015 has two options: continue to exist as an alternate to the 2015 Old Biff created, or cease to exist. Either way, still seems our 2015 would be unreachable by Old Biff and the Delorean on their return from 1955.
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Speculation: Old Biff returns to the changed 2015 (designated 2015A). Doc and Marty "transitioned" to 2015A without noticing. Why didn't they notice? Maybe because they were out on the street when it happened and Hilldale looks the same in 2015A. 

BTW, time travelers "transitioning" between changed timelines is implied by Doc Brow when he tells Marty not to worry about leaving Jennifer on the porch in "alternate 1985". After they restored the timeline Jennifer was still sleeping on the porch.* 

Also, from Futurpedia:


  In scenes deleted from the film, Biff Tannen of 2015 fades out of existence (much like Marty was in the original movie when interfering with his parents' meeting) once arriving in the future, having been erased from existence in that time period. 
  
  This can be explained for two different reasons:
  
  
  First, these events created a time paradox. Having created an alternate timeline by giving his younger self the almanac, the old Biff from 2015 no longer existed, once 2015A became part of the 1985A timeline.
  Another possibility is that Lorraine, in 1996 of the alternate timeline, shot and killed Biff. 
  
  
  These events are never depicted in the trilogy, although Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale suggest this theory as a way of explaining Biff's "disappearance."


I took some screenshots from a YouTube clip:
AnswerKenntnis:
In all the Back to the Future movies, a major component of the plot is reality taking time to catch up to events.  Typically, this is represented as pictures with gradually changing features, which the protagonists are trying to prevent from changing.  Marty's family photo in the first movie, and the tombstone in the third are examples of this.

From this behavior, we can infer it takes time for changes to propagate to the future.  Otherwise, Marty would have blinked out of existence in the first movie as soon as he pushed his father out of the street; and the rest of the movies would have been...  different, to say the least.

So since old Biff returned to his present as soon as he interacted with his younger self, the changes hadn't had time to take effect, yet.  This is also required for Doc and Marty to go back to the 50's.  In the altered future, the new Doc and Marty would neither have had the ability, nor known about the change which needed fixing.
AnswerKenntnis:
Okay I explained something similar to this over on the Sci-fi/Fantasy area. But this one is actually easier to answer. If the change you made in time affects the future you have to wait for it to catch up to you. An example of this is when Marty saves his dad he alters history but it takes about a week to catch up to his present and erase him from time. Even if he had jumped in the time machine and traveled back to 1985 Hill Valley he would of had to wait a week. 

If you travel back into time from an altered future point (from 2015 to Biff altered 1985) the transition is instantaneous. This is because you are traveling down the time stream rather than in static time waiting for events to catch up. 

At first this may seem like a contradiction but it really isn't. My belief is that the Flux Capacitor creates a temporary bubble around time travelers that allow them to be absorbed into a changed time line rather than sudden disruption. So Old Biff would not have been able to travel to future Biff ruled 1985 or even 2015 because he is such a completely different individual in those times as well as the world around him has changed so drastically. Marty was able to travel to an alternative 1985 instantly in the first Back to the Future because it was so close to his current 1985. 

In other words there is one time stream in Back to the Future. It can branch and make new futures but those are eventually absorbed into the one time stream. The further it branches off from the original time stream the longer it takes for changes to catch up to current time. So the answer is the greater the change made to time the longer it takes to affect it especially if there is a possibility of correction to the original time stream.
AnswerKenntnis:
The fact that old Biff made it back to his own timeline should have been an indication to him that his plans didn't work out in the end. There were effectively two timelines old Biff created when he gave the almanac to his younger self.However, once Marty got the almanac back in the alternate 1985, there was then no longer an alternate 2015. The alternate 1985 effectively stopped once Marty was able to fix things again. So when old Biff went back to 2015, there was only one version of 2015, since by that time the alternate timeline had been closed.

Got all that? ;)
AnswerKenntnis:
I believe that 'Back to the Future 2' follows the same logic as the 2005 movie 'A Sound of Thunder' based on the Ray Bradbury story.  In 'A Sound of Thunder' (the movie) when someone went back to the time of the dinosaurs and they made even the smallest change, and then returned to their own time, then sometime later timewaves would catch up to the present and everything would change all at once.  The difference between BTTF2 and 'A Sound of Thunder' is that the timewaves were so subtle in BTTF2 that no one in 2015-B noticed them.  Had Marty and Doc remained in 2015-B long enough, then reality would have changed around them into the 2015-C (Biff-altered reality).  Marty and Doc left 2015-B soon enough to arrive in a 1985-C that the timewaves from 1955-C had already caught up to.
AnswerKenntnis:
When old Biff goes back to 1955 and creates a timeline B (which is reality now), he started to fade in 1955 of timeline A after handing the magazine to his younger self. Maybe this is because he doesn't live to be that old in timeline A after he makes his younger self a billionaire. Maybe it gets him killed before he can get past 1985 and that old. In fact, Marty actually stops timeline B from happening after all. 

So when he was fading back in 1955 after handing in the magazine, he thought the only way he can survive is by quickly going back to the future. But he arrives at the timeline A instead of B because he doesn't even exist in timeline B in 2015 because he gets killed long before 2015 in B. 

Also he still survives in timeline A for few seconds after arriving because of the slow fading theory and because he doesn't belong to timeline A either. Because time still allows you a few minutes to correct your mistakes, Biff arrived in timeline A. 

If he was smarter, he could arrive back in 2015 10 mins earlier so that he could stop himself from taking the Delorean back to 1955, thus stopping any changes or his death or go 10 mins behind in 1955 to stop himself giving the magazine to his younger self. But he was stupid and came to future where time was already changed and he didnt exist, so why A? 

He had a better chance to rectify his mistakes at timeline A than in B. He was more linked to A than B because he came from A and never been to B and the Delorean also belonged to A.  Marty and Doc could not go back in A because they exist in B now. Old Biff doesn't exist in either, but came to A just by the mercy of time as a chance to rectify or bring the Delorean's molecular structure to where it belonged.
AnswerKenntnis:
(Yes, I know this topic was started over an year ago)

I didn't know about Biff's deleted scene where he fades out of existence. Because of that, this has become my point of view:


In BTTF1, Marty traveled back to 1955-A and changed his future, thus creating a 1985-B where he didn't exist. The future took some time to change, but since he was 30 years in the past, changes took longer to catch up to him so it took almost half the movie for him to start disappearing, giving him the chance to fix things. When his parents finally got back together, he created a new 1985-C where he did exist and also time traveled, so he stopped disappearing.
In BTTF2, Doc, Marty and Jennifer traveled to the future. How can their future selfs exist there if they disappeared in 1985? Because the timeline takes time to adjust like in BTTF1. If they had stayed long enough, they would have transitioned/faded into a new 2015 where their future selfs don't exist. Also, any changes they made to their future will be futile because the moment you know something about your future, you're already changing it.
Biff traveled back to 1955-C and drastically changed the future, thus creating 1985-D and 2015-D (we never saw 2015-D). Again, changes took some time to happen, so when he returned to 2015, it was still 2015-C. He eventually faded into 2015-D in the deleted scene (dead or alive, doesn't matter) taking much less time than Marty in the 1st movie.
Doc, Marty and Jennifer were still in 2015-C, but they weren't the ones responsible for the new 2015-D neither they belonged in 2015, so 2015-C only ceased to exist for them when they left in the Delorean. By traveling back to 1985, they entered the new 1985-D timeline created by Biff.
Since they traveled back 30 years into the past, and then another 30 years into 1955, they had enough time to fix things before starting to disappear. The Delorean didn't exist in 1985-D because Doc was in an Asylum and never created it, but since it's the only tie-in between timelines, it cannot simply cease to exist, but it could still take damage, and eventually was destroyed in BTTF3.
In BTTF3, Doc and Marty didn't disappear because their future was fixed, they only needed to return to it. Jennifer was left on the porch in 1985-D and when Doc and Marty shot their way into a new timeline (changing Clayton Ravine to Eastwood Ravine), she transitioned/faded from 1985-D into 1985-E while she was sleeping.


Basically, all the original plot needed to be more consistent was the deleted scene and a better explanation from Doc about the "fading", but that could become too technical for the audience.

Why do studios use Roman numerals in the copyright notice in the end credits?
qn_description:
┬⌐ Time Warner Studios MCMXCVIII

Something like this is almost always used at the very end of the credits creep in movies (and TV shows). But why the cumbersome use of Roman numerals? Why not just say 1998 and be done with it?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
According to David Feldman's book Imponderables: The Solution to the Mysteries of Everyday Life:


  Why are copyrighted dates on movies and television shows written in Roman numerals? 
  
  
  The general consensus is the "deception theory": 
  
  
  to "make it difficult for viewers to determine exactly how old the show is", the reason being the older the date the "staler" the material may seem to the audience.
  
  
  Then there's the "inertia theory": 
  
  
  That's just the way it's always been done.
  
  




This BBC article says something similar:


  Perhaps one of the most notable areas where people are likely to come across Roman numerals is in TV and film credits, where the convention is not to spell out what year something was made.
  
  The practice is believed to have started in an attempt to disguise the age of films or television programmes. In other words, the opposite of claiming an undeserved antiquity.
AnswerKenntnis:
Readability and Internationalization

Movies are mostly produced on reels of film (few are digital). Physical film can degrade over time making it difficult to read numeric values. Some numbers will look exactly the same, for example the number 6 will become 5 when the film becomes old. Where as, roman numerals are easier to read when the film degrades. A lot of television shows are also shot with film.

The other problem is languages. Arabic numbers are hard to distinguish in fine print. Two and three look very similar. So the film industry started using roman numerals to ensure the copyright date was always readable.
AnswerKenntnis:
It's quite often done in order to hide in which year it was created. This way people may think it's older or younger than it actually is. 

And as stated above in a previous answer Arabic numbers are hard to distinguish in fine print.

Dark Knight: Was Gotham Hospital scene a goof-up?
qn_description:
OK, I read it on Facebook, but don't know whether it is true or not.
The scene where the Joker blows Gotham Hospital up was initially not according to plan, but Heath Ledger improvised with his skills. So, initially when he presses the button a very small explosion happens. Then we can observe that Heath Ledger gets confused (which does not look like he is acting to some extent to me) & then presses the remote multiple times. Then suddenly the whole thing blows up, Heath is definitely taken for surprise here.

So, just wanted to know whether there is any proof whether all this was part of the script or was it a goof-up covered up by Heath?
AnswersKenntnis
AnswerKenntnis:
Had a look at the special features on my Blu-ray of The Dark Knight (Special Features, Focus Points, Hospital Explosion), how the scene was planned and filmed is described in some detail.

The scene was shot essentially as it appears, the only computer graphics used was the addition of two rows of glass windows at the top of the building. The delay between the two explosions was deliberate, this was to allow Heath Ledger to be much closer to the building.



The debris that you see flying around is actually pieces of soft cork, fired out of metal drums. The flying glass is stunt glass / breakaway glass, with each window shattered individually with its own charge.





The Focus Point doesn't explicitly say whether or not fiddling with the remote was Heath Ledger's idea. It does say:


  We rehearsed endlessly with Heath that morning. We walked him out, got him to do exactly what he was going to do, Chris Corbould [special effects supervisor] calling the explosions, where they would take place. We rehearsed it, I think, about twelve times.


So if Heath Ledger did improvise with the remote, it sounds like he did it in rehearsal rather than on the spot with things exploding all around him.
AnswerKenntnis:
I'm thinking this is urban legend, only because it's hard to believe that the scene was not the product of special effects.

When he presses the button, Ledger has just exited the hospital and is still very close to it -- within a distance that has to be much closer than he would ever be allowed to stand while filming, due to danger from flying debris, broken glass, and other hazards. It seems impossible that the film's insurers -- let alone other safety-conscious bureacracies, not to mention common sense -- would allow the scene to be filmed truly as it appears.

I would guess that the demolition of the building was filmed separately from the part where Ledger appears to be pressing the button, and then the two were combined, probably using blue-screen or similar technology. So the crew probably had a chance to watch the demolition film, noticed the delayed explosions, and then had Ledger incorporate the frustrated button-pressing.
AnswerKenntnis:
From everything I've read of this scene, I can't find any official sources.

But what there is a common consensus.

Obviously, due to the nature of having an abandoned building given to the production crew, the explosion scene had a one chance deal and one chance only to get the scene proper.  Not exactly within the production budget to blow up a building and rebuild it should you need to shoot the scene again.

During his individual part, Ledger pressed the button and the explosion was set to go off from that.  Obviously, murphy's law seemed to happen and that wasn't the case.  But instead of calling cut or waiting for a production crew to cue him into when it'll actually happen and have the scene be edited, Ledger stayed in character and did what the Joker would do:  Fidgit with the thing until it actually worked.

I wish I could find some official sources on this to further prove this point but that seems to be the case, he covered up for a improperly timed explosion with one of the greatest scenes of the movie.
AnswerKenntnis:
From what I have read the delayed explosion was planned, it was to go off for the shot of the bus driving across the parking lot (as it did), and Heath Ledger used the delay to improvise the fidgiting of the clicker.
QuestionKenntnis:
Is there any evidence of "Big Twist" movies having poor post-cinema sales?
qn_description:
I have watched many movies such as Sixth Sense, where there is a major twist that if known prior to watching the movie can potentially spoil the enjoyment of viewing. I tend not to watch this type of movies again, or certainly no more than once, and wondered if this is a common reaction.

Is there any evidence that would suggest that comparatively, this type of films, whilst they may do well at cinema, have relatively poor post-cinema sales (I am thinking of the ratio between box-office and DVD/BluRay sales). So, for any budding directors, is this the type of movie to shy away from?

AnswerKenntnis:
A properly executed plot twist often causes opposite reactions of what you've just described. People want to watch the movie again because the ending was so unexpected that they need to review the whole thing to get all the puzzle pieces together. "Fight Club" is a great example, in my opinion. There's a lot of dialogue (especially the lines from Helena Bonham Carter) that doesn't make any sense if you don't know the ending. You will enjoy and understand Fight Club much better after a second view.

There are many ingredients that define the quality and longevity of a movie. Directors should not be afraid to use a plot twist, but relying only on this trick - especially if it is predictable - may ruin the whole experience.
